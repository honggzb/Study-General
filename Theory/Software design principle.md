## KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

- just may be the engineer’s ultimate motto

## DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)

- An effective code can be highly reusable and that’s is a good thing, but it doesn’t mean that this piece of code should be repeated in various places within a program. Instead of repeating yourself and your code, see if there is a way to combine all snippets into a single task, thus minimizing the time of efforts you will spend if it is necessary to make any corrections in the future
