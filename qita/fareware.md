Hello All,

As most of you know, today is my last working day at xxx. Over the last 4 years, I have had the opportunity to work alongside great folks like yourself.

Thanks to all of my colleagues (A, B, C) for supporting me over the years. I had a lot of fun working and learning beside you.

Thanks to all the xxx team members for sticking around and tolerating my leadership style over the years. A few of you (A, B, C and a lot of xxx members) were here when I first joined in xxxx and were part of the original team that released v5.2 to xxx. A, V, B I wont forget the late evenings and early mornings of those times.
Since then our team has strengthened with each new member. A, B and C joined us right after v5.2 had been released and xxx program was gaining speed and we had fun like never before. A and B joined us and helped me in scaling up the teams when I needed help the most.

I remain grateful to all the hard work that each and every one of you have put in towards xxx. I have been given the credit for success that honestly belongs to each and every one of you.

There are just too many folks for me to personally name who have played a role in making my stay at xxx really positive, successful and fun. Forgive me if I have missed you.

I am taking a lot of fond memories with me. I am happy and content that not only did we work beside each other but I can call a lot of you my friends. I wish you all, great times and a bright future ahead. Hopefully our paths will cross again.

Please stay in touch - my personal number is ...
