## Standup Questions !

Each team member should answer these 3 questions:

2.	What will I do today to help the development team to meet the sprint goal?
3.	Are there any impediments that prevent me or the development team from meeting the sprint goal?

## ? Meet After 
During the Daily Scrum, in case we have lot of topics which arises that the participants want to discuss with each other. However, these topics don't concern the entire team. In this case we need to capture these topics and then we can address these topics with the relevant team members in a different call as sit-down call.
Kindly let me know if you have any question or suggestions.
