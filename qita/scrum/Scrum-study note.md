Project are impacted by

- Time, cost, scope, quality, resources, organiztional capabilities, other limitations

## Scrum Overview

- Adaptive, iterative, fast, flexible, and effective
- Ensures transparency in communication
- Creates collective accountability and progress
- Scrum framework supports all kinds of projects regardless of its complexibility

### Scrum Five Values

- Commitment, courage, focus, openness, respect

### Scrum Theory

## Scrum three Pillars

Empirical Process Control’s Three Pillars

|Pillars| |
|---|--|
|Transparency|Use of common language and defintions|
|Inspection|Inspections of progress and artifacts|
|Adaption|Adjustments to minimize deviation|

## Scrum Team

### Product Owner

- **Final authority on requirements**
- Prioritize backlog and provide clear requirements, manages backlog, optimizes value of Dev. Team,
- Shows what scrum team to work on next, Makes sure that dev. Team understands the items,
- 1 person, may represent desires of a committee,
- Addressed regarding backlog changes, tells dev. Team to work on different requirements (and nobody else),
- Cancels sprints (an nobody else)

### Development Team

- Self-managing, cross-functional, developers (no sub-teams) **3-9** professionals (no master/owner) accountable for a development.
- Delivers the releasable increment of "Done" (End of Sprint), while nobody else tells how to turn backlog into "Done"
- Can included project manager, developer, tester, Swiss Army Knife, CTM, TOC

### Scrum Master

- **Servant/Leader** to a team, may work with other scrum masters to maximize effectiveness
- Facilitator, negotiator, responsible for guiding team
- Ensures that team follows Scrum rules, maximizes team's value, understands product planning, agility/facilitates scrum events
- Removes impediments or finds someone that can

|Relationship to| |
|---|--|
|Product Owner|- Finds techniques for backlog management keeping it clear and concise, and arranged to maximize value<br>- Understanding product planning, practices agility and Facilitates Scrum events as requested or needed|
|Development Team|- helps team understand the clarity of a backlog, helps team deliver high-value product, helps teams adopt scrum<br>- Coaches self-organization and cross-functionality, removes impediments in progress, facilitates scrum events|
|Organization|- Coaches scrum adoption, plans scrum implementations, helps employees to understand scrum<br>- Planning Scrum implementations , causes changes that increases the productivity and increases the effectiveness (with or without other Masters)|
|Stake-Holders|- Helps stakeholders understand scrum|

## Events(Sprint)

### Scrum Flow

![](https://i.imgur.com/FkaxStX.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/rXzXexg.png)

- Definition: Minimized and time-boxed meetings designed for transparency and inspection (and adoption). Starts immediately after a conclusion of previous Sprint. Changes that endanger the sprint goal are not allowed, scope clarified and re-negotiated, backlog reviewed.
- Duration: 1 month or less (with a releasable "Done" increment). Can be canceled before expiry (obsolete goals).
  - 1-6 weeks
- Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team .
- Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint (maybe under influence from the stakeholders, the Development Team, or the Scrum Master).

### Sprint Planning

- Definition: Answers what can be delivered at increment, and how to achieve it After forecasting backlog, goal is made
- Duration: 8 hrs. or less, for a 1-month sprint (less for shorter sprints)
- Objectives:
  - Sprint goal
  - Sprint backlog
- Product Owner and relevenet stakeholders are provided a demonstration of the **Deliverables**
- Product Owner accepts the delivables only if they meet the **predefined acceptance criteria**
- PO describes highest priorities
- Detailed tasks created and assigned

### Dialy Scrum

- Definition: Improves communications, eliminates other meetings, identifies impediments to development for removal, highlights and promote quick decision-making, and improves the Development Team's level of knowledge.
- Duration: 15 minutes, time boxed, usually in the morning/same location
- Every attendee
  - What did you do yesterday?
  - What will you do today?
  - Is there any impediment on your way?
- Scrum master helps remove impediments
  - Or find someone who will

### Sprint review

- Definition: Scrum team and stakeholders (optional) collaborate on what was done and what to do. Is informal meeting to gain a better insight and collaboration.
- Duration: 4hrs. or less for 1-month sprint (or shorter for shorter sprints).
- Goal: Ship Ready State!
  - Scrum Deliver Potentially Shippable Product
- Hold a meeting to present the outcome
- Typically a demo
- Assessed towards the sprint goal

### Sprint Retrospective

- Objective: Improve processes and performance, determine ways to improve at end of sprint
- Definition: Team inspects itself and plans the next sprint
- Duration: 3hrs or less for a 1-month sprint (or shorter for shorter sprints)
- Suggestion: (What should we…)
  - Start doing?
  - Stop doing?
  - Continue doing?

|Events|should do|
|---|---|
| |**Sprint Planning**|
|Product Owner|discusses the objective of Sprint and Product Backlog items to achieve the Sprint Goal|
|Scrum Master |Ensures that the event takes place and that attendants understand its purpose, keeping it within time-box|
|Development Team|- Forecasts the functionality that will be developed during the Sprint by assessing what it can accomplish over the upcoming Sprint.<br>- Decides how it will build this functionality into a "Done" product Increment during the Sprint.<br>- Decomposes the backlog units to 1 day or less, by self-organizing.<br>- Determines it has too much or too little work, and if so, renegotiates with owner.<br>- May explain the steps that it will take to make the next increment ("Done").|
| |**Daily Scrum**|
Product Owner| |
|Scrum Master |Ensures that the Development Team has the meeting, keeping within a time-box.|
|Development Team|- Responsible for conducting the Daily Scrum, enforces the rule that only Development Team participates.<br>- Synchronizes activities and creates a plan for the next 24 hours, inspecting a progress toward the Sprint Goal.|
| |**Sprint Review**|
|Product Owner|Can invite key Stake-Holders (informal), Explains what was and was not done, Discusses the current state of Product Backlog|
|Scrum Master |May invite Stakeholders.|
|Development Team|Discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it ran into, and how those problems were solved; demonstrates the work that it has "Done" and answers questions about the Increment|
|Stake-Holders|Can attend, if and only if, invited by Scrum Master.|
| |**Sprint Retrospective**|
Product Owner||
|Scrum Master |Participates as a peer team member in the meeting from the accountability over the Scrum process|
|Development Team||

## Artifacts

Scrum’s artifacts represent work or value to provide transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaptation

### Product backlog

- Definition:  ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product
- Duration: Never complete
- Not required to be complete at the beginning

### Sprint backlog

- Definition: Set of product backlogs designed to convert backlog to "Done", while all units are decomposed to 1-day tasks (or less). Too much or too little work is re-negotiated with the product owner. Others may attend for a better insight. After it is established, team must be able to tell owner how to accomplish the sprint-goal

### Increment

- Definition: Next logical step completing a definition of "Done".

|Artifacts|Team member|should do|
|---|---|---|
|Product Backlog|Product Owner|- Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog (content, availability, and ordering), and can update it at any time.<br>- Refines the backlog with Dev. Team.<br>- Monitors progress but does not make the final (work) estimates. Assesses the progress, making it transparent to all stakeholders.|
| |Scrum Master ||
| |Development Team|- Refines the backlog with Product Owner, does all work estimates and forecasts.<br>- Modifies the Sprint Backlog throughout the Sprint, and the Sprint Backlog emerges during the Sprint.|
|Sprint Backlog|Product Owner|- The Product Owner is the sole person responsible (accountable) for managing the Product Backlo.<br>- May represent the desires of a committee in the Product Backlog.<br>-Is addressed if any change to be done to a Backlog.<br>- Express Backlog items, Orders items to achieve goal, optimize value of development team work, ensure transparency and understanding of items.<br>- No-one else can tell Development Team to work on different requirements.|
| |Scrum Master ||
| |Development Team|-Express Backlog items, Orders items to achieve goal, optimize value of development team work, Ensure transparency and understanding of items.<br>- Does not act on anyone's requirements other than the ones of the product Owner.<br>- Only the Development Team can change its Sprint Backlog during a Sprint|
