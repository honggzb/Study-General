- More isolated testing
  - We want to test the services and components in question, not their dependencies
- Strongly typed template checking
  - If a child component definition changes, we want to ensure that dependent unit tests are breaking
- Less coupling between components and services
  - Dependency Injection makes it easy to inject services, but if those services are being used all over the shop, refactoring becomes difficult
- Prefer dumb components over smart components
  - Dumb components (i.e. those that rely on inputs and outputs) are much easier to test than components dependent on multiple services
