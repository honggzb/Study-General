## Storage Components

### Types of Azure Disk storage

- use **.VHD(Virtual** hard disk file in VM)
- or use standard HDD,SSD
- or use Ultra and premium SSD

**IOPS-** Input and Output Operations per Second

### Configure Azure Disk Storage

### Azure Blob Storage

- BLOB- Binary Large OBjects
- used as unstructured data storage
- take snapshots
- storage tier
  - **cool** storage tier -> not frequent access
  - **hot** storage tier -> optimized for frequent access
- BLOBs Types, all over accessible through http/https
  - Block BLOBs
    - used for small and large files
    - multiple block BLOBs can be uploaded concurrently
    - useful for storage of picture, office productivity documents
  - Page BLOBs
    - used for large file cloud storage
    - designed for random read and write access
    - useful for .VHD files
  - Append BLOBs
    - Designed so that new data can only by added to the end of the existing BLOB
    - existing blocks cannot be updated or deleted
    - useful for logging
- BLOB Hierarchy
  - Storage account: sa123   -> http://sa123
    - BLOB container: pics       -> http://sa123.blob.core.windows.net/pics
      - BLOB: pic1.jpg             -> http://sa123.blob.core.windows.net/pics/pic1.jpg

### Create a storage account
### Azure BLOB storage management

`get-command-*storageaccount*`

1. Azure GUI management: portal
2. Azure CLI management
   1. create a storage account -> `az storage account create -n stor2020 -g rg1 -l canadaeast --sku "Standard_LRS"`
   2. view                     -> `az storage account list | find "name"`
   3. view keys                -> `az storage account keys list --account-name stor2020 --resource-group rg1 --output table`
   4. create a container       -> `az storage container create --name pics --account-name stor2020 --account-key xxxxxxx`
   5. upload blobs             -> `az storage blob upload --container-name pics --name mypicture.jpg --file c:\samplefiles\mypicture.jpg --account-name stor2020 --account-key xxxxxxx`

   2. `get--azstorageaccount`
   3. `$ctx=get-azstorageaccount -r rg1 -name stor2020` -> define a variable, then we can use `$ctx.context` instead of `get-azstorageaccount -r rg1 -name stor2020`
   1. `new-azstoragecontainer -name "pics" -context $ctx.context`
   2. `set-azstorageblobcontent -file c:\samplefiles\mypicture.jpg -container pics -blob mypicture.jpg -context $ctx.context`

  - IPv4 CIDR notation
    - 10.1.0.0/16,
    - 10.1 -> network of this Vnet
  - Firewalls and DDos protection
  - VNets contain subnets
- Advantages
  - Isolate deployed Azure resources
  - VNets can link to other VNets(peering)
  - VNets can link to an on-premised networdk
  - VNet DNS can be customized
  - Private and public IP address
- Azure Virtual Subnets
  - are assigned a NSG and route table
  - Subnet IP address range must fall within the parent VNet range
  - Subnet IP address range can be changed at any time

### Azure Virtual Networks Management

- GUI
- CLI command
  - `az network vnet --help`
  - `az network vnet create --help`
  - `az network vnet create -g rg1 -n EastVnet2 --address-prefix 14.1.0.0/16 --subnet-name Subnet1 --subnet-prefix 14.1.1.0/24`
  - `az network vnet list | find "name"`
- PowerShell cmdlets
  - `$vnet=new-azvirtualnetwork -resourcegroupname rg1 -location canadaeast 0name EastVnet3 -addressprfix 15.1.0.0/16`
  - `$subnet=add-azvirtualnetworksubnetconfig -name Subnet1 -addressprefix 15.1.1.0/24 -virtualnetwork $vnet`
  - `$vnet|set-azvirtualnetwork`

### Azure IP addressing

- Allow different service to communicate
- Types - Public/Private address
  - Public address
    - IPv4 or IPv6
    - static and dynamic allocation
    - allows incoming/outgoing internet connection
    - Public IPv6 - public-facing load balances only
  - Private address
    - IPv4 or IPv6
    - static and dynamic allocation
    - Allocated or set from the Vnet subnet IP range
    - used within a VNet or VPN/ExpressRoute
- Allocation - Dynamic/Static IP address
  - Dynamic IP address
    - IP address is released when resource is stopped or deleled(Such as VM stop/start)
    - Useful when the IP address does not have to remain the same
  - Static IP address
    - IP address stays with the resource until it is deleted
    - Useful when the IP address must remain the same
    - Static IPs are assigned by azure from an address pool

### Azure VPN Gateway

- Encrypted tunnel between two endpoints
  - Vnet to Vnet
  - On-premises network to Vnet
- need to define gateway subnet in Azure virtual network
  - the subnet must be named 'GatewaySubnet'

    - SSTP an IPsec protocol
    - VPN device not required
    - Single device VPN connection
    - Useful for travelling users
      - Secure access to Azure
  - Site-to-site
    - IPsec protocol
    - On-premise to Vnet
      - need VPN device
      - Windows RRAS
      - Public-facing IPv4 address
    - no VPN device if it is Vnet to Vnet
- Configuration
  - Point-to-site
    1. create a gateway subnet
    2. create Virtual network gateway
    3. PKI certificate   <- client connect to point-to-site VPN need PKI authenticate
    4. ...

### Azure Application Gateway

- Load balanceer for web application traffic
- difference with traditional load balance
  - traditional load balance -> traffic is routed based on **IP address and port**
  - Azure application gateway -> trafic routing based on **URL**
- Session affinity: can be used to maintain a user session on the same back-end server
- Web application Firewall(WAF)
  - Available through the Azure application gateway
  - Firewall designed to block web application exploits
    - cross-site request forgeries
    - directory traversal
    - cross-site scripting

## Azure Network Security

- Azure Firewall
- Azure DDoS mitigation
- Network security groups

### Azure Firewall

- Azure firewall is a cloud managed resource that can control inbound and outbound traffic to an from Azure
- Azure firewall gets associated with Azure Vnet subnets
  - other Vnets can connect in a hub and spoke fashion
  - requires a subnet named **AzureFirewallSubnet**, which treated as virtual appliance
- Azure firewall has a **static public IP address**
- Can create firewall, network and application rules to control in and outbound traffic
- Application Rules, create a route **table** resource(which associated with Azure Vnet subnets) to control **outbound** traffic based on fully qualified domain names or FQDNs
  - Allow inbound access to Azure services
    - On-premises network
    - Internet
  - TCP and UDP
  - Destination Network Address Translation(DNAT)
    - IP an port public to private translation
  - Priority value determines order of rule execution
  - Rule are placed int o a **collection**, for example DNAT

#### Azure Firewall Network rules

- support TCP, UDP, ICMP, Any
- Source and destination IP address
- Destination Port
- Userful to allow communication between subnets
- Allow or deny actions

#### Azure Firewall Application rules

- outbound connectivity
  - need build a route table(Azure Object) for subnet
- Specify fully Qualified Domain Names(FQDNs)
  - wildcards are allowed, such as *.domain.com or *
- Protocol:port, such as HTTPS:443
- Allow or deny actions, such as white list of FQDNs

### Azure DDoS Migration

- Distributed Denial of Service(DDoS)
- "Basic" protection is enabled automatically at no cost
- "Standard"
  - Configured in Vnet properties
  - Adaptive tuning based on deployed VNet resources
  - you will get alerts when there is DDoS attack

### Azure Network Security Groups(NSGs)

- NSG is a resource that can be associated with NICs, subnets
  - Network Interfave Cards(NICs) is used by an Azure VM so to control traffic into and out of that VM
- NSG can create
  - **inbound** network security rules: such as associated with subnets
  - **outbound** network security rules
- Each rule has a priority value
- Allow and Deny actions: traffic can be allowed or denied
- Default rules
  - Load balancing
  - Inter-VNet communication
  - Incoming Internet traffic is blocke
  - Outbound Internet traffic is allowed by default
- Management tools
  - Azure Portal
  - PowerShell
    - `new-AzNetworkSecurityGroup -name Linux_NSG -resourcegroupname RG1 -location canadaeast`
    - `Get-AzNetworkSecurityGroup | select name`
    - `Get-AzNetworkSecurityGroup -name linux_nsg -resourcegroupname rg1 | add-AznetworkSecurityRuleCOnfig -name AllowSSH -access aloww -protocol tcp -direction inbound -priority 220 -sourceaddressprefix * -sourceportrange * -destinationaddressprefix * -destinationportrange 22 | set-AzNetworkSecurityGroup`
    - `Remove-AzNetworkSecurityGroup`
  - CLI
    - `az network nsg create -g Rg1 -n windows_NSG`, `az network nsg create --help`
    - `az network nsg list | find "name"`
