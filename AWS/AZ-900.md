## Module 1: Cloud Concepts(15-20%)

### Cloud Computing Considertaions

- Cloud services that meet business needs
- On-premises system/data cloud migration
- Technical expertise of IT staff
- Total cost of ownership(TCO)
- Data privacy and laws/regulations

**BYOL**- allows cloud customers to reuse existing software licenses

### Cloud computing terms(Exam tips)

- **High availability** means VMs can spin up fast to help processs requests
- **Fault tolerance** describes how Azure will ensure you have zero downtime for services provided by Azure
- **Disaster recovery** uses time-to-recovery and recovery point metrics to recover from tornadoes, floods and more
- **Scalability** refers to scaling out or scaling up
- **Elasticity** is the ability to quickly increase or decrease computer processing and resources
- **Agility** means to the ability to rapidly develop, test and launch software applications

### Economies of scale

- **CapEx** (Capital Expenditure):
  - Money spend by a business or organization on acquiring or maintaining fixed assets, such as land, buildings and equipment
  - large upfront investments
- **OpEx** (Operational Expenditure):
  - cloud computing with a pay-as-you-go model
  - An ongoing cost fro running a product, business, or system on a day-to-day basic, including annual costs
- **exam Tips**
  - CapEx: buying hardware outright, paid upfront as a one time purchase
  - OpEx:  ongoing costs needed to run your business
  - Comsumption-based pricing let's you pay only for what you use

- How to determination deployment
  - Vnet location(region)
  - IPv4 CIDR notation
    - 10.1.0.0/16,
    - 10.1 -> network of this Vnet
  - Firewalls and DDos protection
  - VNets contain subnets
- Advantages
  - Isolate deployed Azure resources
  - VNets can link to other VNets(peering)
  - VNets can link to an on-premised networdk
  - VNet DNS can be customized
  - Private and public IP address
- Azure Virtual Subnets
  - are assigned a NSG(network Security Group) and route table
  - Subnet IP address range must fall within the parent VNet range
  - Subnet IP address range can be changed at any time

#### Azure Virtual Networks Management

- GUI
- CLI command
  - `az network vnet --help`
  - `az network vnet create --help`
  - `az network vnet create -g rg1 -n EastVnet2 --address-prefix 14.1.0.0/16 --subnet-name Subnet1 --subnet-prefix 14.1.1.0/24`
  - `az network vnet list | find "name"`
- PowerShell cmdlets
  - `$vnet=new-azvirtualnetwork -resourcegroupname rg1 -location canadaeast 0name EastVnet3 -addressprfix 15.1.0.0/16`
  - `$subnet=add-azvirtualnetworksubnetconfig -name Subnet1 -addressprefix 15.1.1.0/24 -virtualnetwork $vnet`
  - `$vnet|set-azvirtualnetwork`

    - used within a VNet or VPN/ExpressRoute
- Allocation - Dynamic/Static IP address
  - Dynamic IP address
    - IP address is released when resource is stopped or deleled(Such as VM stop/start)
    - Useful when the IP address does not have to remain the same
  - Static IP address
    - IP address stays with the resource until it is deleted
    - Useful when the IP address must remain the same
    - Static IPs are assigned by azure from an address pool

#### Azure VPN Gateway

- Encrypted tunnel between two endpoints
  - Vnet to Vnet
  - On-premises network to Vnet

**Scale Sets**

- Scale Sets are a group of identical, can be activated or deactivated as needed,
- load balanced VMs
- Benefits
  - simple to manage multiple VMs using a load balancer
  - High availability: if one VM fails or stops, the others in the scale set will keep working
  - Auto scaling
  - Large scale: run up to 1000 Vms in a single scle set
  - No extra cost, you only pay for the VM, storage and networking resources you use. Nothing additional for scale sets

#### Azure Container Instances

- Hosts and run your containers on Azure
- Containers have less overhead than VM and can be deployed consistently

**Azure Kubernetes Service**

- open source tool for orchestrating and managing many container images and applications
- uses clusters and pods to scle and deploy application

#### App Service

- managed platform to host your application
- Web App, Containers and API
- support a lot of programming languages

#### Serverless compute

- Serverless computing is the abstraction of servers, infrastructure, and OSs. With serverless computing, Azure takes care of managing the server infrastructure and allocation/deallocation of resources based on demand
  - serverless Azure offering
  - a function does one compute action each time it is invoked
- Azure has two implementations of serverless compute:
  - **Azure Functions** which can execute code in almost any modern language
  - **Azure Logic Apps** which are designed in a web-based designer and can execute logic triggered by Azure services without writing any code
