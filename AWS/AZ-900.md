## Module 1: Cloud Concepts(15-20%)

### Cloud Computing Considertaions

- Cloud services that meet business needs
- On-premises system/data cloud migration
- Technical expertise of IT staff
- Total cost of ownership(TCO)
- Data privacy and laws/regulations

**BYOL**- allows cloud customers to reuse existing software licenses

### Economies of scale

- CapEx (Capital expenditure)
- OpEx (operational expenditure)

### Cloud Models

models|characteristics
---|---
Public Cloud | owned by, operated by, maintained by Cloud Providers
Private Cloud | owned by, operated by, maintained by organizations that uses resources from that cloud
Hybrid Cloud | such as hosting a website in public cloud and linking it to highly secure database

### Types of Cloud Services

Type|Terms|User|Use case
---|---|---|---
IaaS|Infrastructure As A Service|System administrator|Migrating workloads, Test and Dev, Website Hosting, Backup, storaer and recovery
PaaS|Platform As A Service|	Developer|DBMS, Web Application Hosting, Container Orchestration, Big data service
SaaS|Software As A Service|	cmd users| office 365, salesforce, facebook, Gmail

## Module 2: Core Azure Services(30-35%)

### Azure Architectural Components

#### Azure Regions

- Geograhical location consisting of one or more AZs
- Charactoristic
  - Geographical
  - 60 regions, 140 countries
  - Undisclosed Azure government regions
- Special regions
  - US DOD: Central/Viginia/lowa
  - China:  East/Norht
  - Germany: Central/North east
- https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/regions/

#### Regional Pairs

- Each region is paired with another region within the same geography
- This approach allows for replication of resources
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/best-practices-availability-paired-regions

![georegiondatacenter](https://github.com/honggzb/Study-General/blob/master/AWS/images/georegiondatacenter.png)

#### Feature(Azure service) Availability

- All Azure service are not available in regions
  - varies by region: always changes
- Global service
  - Azure AD(Active Directory)
  - Traffic manager
  - Azure DNS
- https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/

#### Availability Zones(AZs)

- Within a Azure region
  - normally at least three AZs
- One or more data centers with high-speed network links
- Provide:
  - Low latency
  - High Availability
  - Resiliency

#### Availability Sets

- Update Domain
  - A logical section of a data center
  - use for schedule maintenance prerformance or security updates
- Fault Domain
  - A physical separation of your workloads across different hardware in a data center

#### Azure Resource Groups

- Metering and Billing
- Apply policies
- monitoring & Alerts
- Quotas
- Access Control

#### Azure Resource Manager(ARM)

- Mangaged related resources(web application, databases, storage accounts, VM) as a group
- Used for Azure resource deployment(through ARM to deploy resources)
- Provides Azure resource management
- management tools
  - GUI(Azure portal), command line
  - ARM template(.JSON file format) by using Azure CLI or Azure Powershell

### Azure Service and products

## Module 3: Security, Privacy, Compliance and Trust(25-30%)

### Azure Firewall

1. create a Vnet in resource group with 3 subnet
   1. create subnet for Jump server
   2. create subnet for production workloads
   3. create subnet fro azure firewall
2. create VM in Jump server
   1. make sure there is public inbound ports(windows )
   2. make sure there is public IP
3. create VM in production subnet
   1. make sure there is no public inbound ports
   2. make sure there is no public IP
4. create azure firewall in firewall subnet
   1. make sure there is public IP address
5. create a route table
   1. attach to prod subnet
   2. add a route in route table to map the next hop addres to private address of axzureFirewall
6. in az firewall -> write application rule to allow xxx.xxx.com
