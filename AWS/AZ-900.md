### The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing

- Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction

### Cloud computing service

- computer power = VMs + Hypervisor +hardware
- storage
- networking
- analytics

### Cloud computing characteristics

- Broad access
- Resource pooling
- Rapid elasticity
- self-provisioning
- metered usage

### Benefits of Cloud computing

- Cost-effective
- Scalability
- Elasticity
- Current/Updated
- Reliable(fault colerance)

## Key Concepts and Terms

- High Availability: very little downtime depending on the service in question
- Scalability:  the ability to increase or decrease resources for any given workload
- Elasticity:   the ability to automatically or dynamically increase or decrease the resources as needed
- Agility:  the ability to react quickly
- Fault tolerance: the ability to remain up and running even in the event of component or service failure
- Disaster Recovery:
- Global Reach:
- Customer Latency capability: Cloud service have the ability to deploy resources and data centers around the globe so thereby it will be addressing customers latency issues
- Predictive cost considerations:
- Techinical skill requirements
- Increased Productivity
- Security

### Type of Cloud Models

- Pulic Cloud
- Private Cloud
- Hybrid Cloud

### Types of Cloud Services

 Type|Terms | User
 ---|---|---
IaaS | Infrastructure As A Service |System administrator
PaaS | Platform As A Service  | Developer
SaaS | Software As A Service | cmd users

### Capex vs. Opex

- Capex(capital expenditure)
  - is a business expense incurred to create future benefit
  - Capex are expenditures creating future benefits. A capital expenditure is incurred when a business spends money either to buy fixed assets or to add to the value of an existing asset with a useful life that extends beyond the tax year.
- Opex(operational expenditure)
  - Opex is the money the business spends in order to turn inventory into throughput. Operating expenses also include depreciation of plants and machinery which are used in the production process
  - refers to expenses incurred in the course of ordinary business, such as sales, general and administrative expenses (and excluding cost of goods sold - or COGS, taxes, depreciation and interest)
