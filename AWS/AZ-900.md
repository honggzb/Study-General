## Module 1: Cloud Concepts(15-20%)

### Cloud Computing Considertaions

- Cloud services that meet business needs
- On-premises system/data cloud migration
- Technical expertise of IT staff
- Total cost of ownership(TCO)
- Data privacy and laws/regulations

**BYOL**- allows cloud customers to reuse existing software licenses

### Cloud computing terms(Exam tips)

- **High availability** means VMs can spin up fast to help processs requests
- **Fault tolerance** describes how Azure will ensure you have zero downtime for services provided by Azure
- **Disaster recovery** uses time-to-recovery and recovery point metrics to recover from tornadoes, floods and more
- **Scalability** refers to scaling out or scaling up
- **Elasticity** is the ability to quickly increase or decrease computer processing and resources
- **Agility** means to the ability to rapidly develop, test and launch software applications

### Economies of scale

- **CapEx** (Capital Expenditure):
  - Money spend by a business or organization on acquiring or maintaining fixed assets, such as land, buildings and equipment
  - large upfront investments
- **OpEx** (Operational Expenditure):
  - cloud computing with a pay-as-you-go model
  - An ongoing cost fro running a product, business, or system on a day-to-day basic, including annual costs
- exam Tips
  - CapEx: buying hardware outright, paid upfront as a one time purchase
  - OpEx:  ongoing costs needed to run your business
  - Comsumption-based pricing let's you pay only for what you use

### Cloud Architect Models

models|characteristics|pros|cons
---|---|---|---
Public Cloud | owned by, operated by, maintained by Cloud Providers|No purchase of hardware, low monthly fees|No control over features and versions, no physical access
Private Cloud | owned by, operated by, maintained by organizations that uses resources from that cloud||maintenance, staffing
Hybrid Cloud | such as hosting a website in public cloud and linking it to highly secure database|avoid disruptions and outages, adhere to regulation, governance etc| complex infrastructure

### Types of Cloud Services Models

Type|Terms|User|Use case
---|---|---|---
IaaS|Infrastructure As A Service|System administrator|Migrating workloads, Test and Dev, Website Hosting, Backup, storaer and recovery
PaaS|Platform As A Service|	Developer|DBMS, Web Application Hosting, Container Orchestration, Big data service
SaaS|Software As A Service|	cmd users| office 365, salesforce, facebook, Gmail

- IaaS
  - infrastruture = actual servers
  - scaling is fast 
  - No owenership of hardware
  - provides servers, storage and networking as a service
- PaaS
  - superset of IaaS
  - PaaS supports web application life cycle
  - Avoids software license hell
  - such as database management tools
- SaaS
  - Providing a managed service
  - Pay an access fee to use
  - No maintenance an latest features
  - such as Office 365
- Serverless
  - Azure funtions is the best know serverless service
  - Extreme PaaS

## Module 2: Core Azure Services(30-35%)

### Azure Architectural Components

#### Azure Regions

- Geograhical location consisting of one or more AZs
- Charactoristic
  - Geographical
  - 60 regions, 140 countries
  - Undisclosed Azure government regions
- Special regions
  - US DOD: Central/Viginia/lowa
  - China:  East/Norht
  - Germany: Central/North east
- https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/regions/

#### Regional Pairs

- Each region is paired with another region within the same geography
- This approach allows for replication of resources
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/best-practices-availability-paired-regions

![georegiondatacenter](https://github.com/honggzb/Study-General/blob/master/AWS/images/georegiondatacenter.png)

#### Feature(Azure service) Availability

- All Azure service are not available in regions
  - varies by region: always changes
- Global service
  - Azure AD(Active Directory)
  - Traffic manager
  - Azure DNS
- https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/

#### Availability Zones(AZs)

- Within a Azure region
  - normally at least three AZs
- One or more data centers with high-speed network links
- Provide:
  - Low latency
  - High Availability
  - Resiliency

#### Availability Sets

- Update Domain
  - A logical section of a data center
  - use for schedule maintenance prerformance or security updates
- Fault Domain
  - A physical separation of your workloads across different hardware in a data center

#### Azure Resource Groups

- Metering and Billing
- Apply policies
- monitoring & Alerts
- Quotas
- Access Control

#### Azure Resource Manager(ARM)

- Mangaged related resources(web application, databases, storage accounts, VM) as a group
- Used for Azure resource deployment(through ARM to deploy resources)
- Provides Azure resource management
- management tools
  - GUI(Azure portal), command line
  - ARM template(.JSON file format) by using Azure CLI or Azure Powershell

## Module 3: Security, Privacy, Compliance and Trust(25-30%)

### Azure Firewall

1. create a Vnet in resource group with 3 subnet
   1. create subnet for Jump server
   2. create subnet for production workloads
   3. create subnet fro azure firewall
2. create VM in Jump server
   1. make sure there is public inbound ports(windows )
   2. make sure there is public IP
3. create VM in production subnet
   1. make sure there is no public inbound ports
   2. make sure there is no public IP
4. create azure firewall in firewall subnet
   1. make sure there is public IP address
5. create a route table
   1. attach to prod subnet
   2. add a route in route table to map the next hop addres to private address of axzureFirewall
6. in az firewall -> write application rule to allow xxx.xxx.com
