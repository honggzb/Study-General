## Strategies to Follow

- If a page/view changes, manage the page title properly
- Be sure to use proper semantic HTML where possible
- No semantic HTML, then use ARIA to properly markup the content.
- Try to limit the use of custom HTML tags
- Be sure to manage focus properly whenever asynchronous content is used.
- Use accessibility testing tools such as axe-core to test your content for accessibility issues as you code your components
