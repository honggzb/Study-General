## Frontend System Design Components

```
ðŸ”¸Architectural Patterns Protocol |ðŸ”¸Communication 
  - Iframe                        |    - REST/GraphQL/inMemory
  - Web components                |ðŸ”¸Availability
  - Module Federation             |    - offline support: Sevice Worker
  - MicroApps / Route based       |ðŸ”¸Accessibility
ðŸ”¸Consistency                     |ðŸ”¸Credibility & Trust
  - CSS propeties --> Polyfills   |    - SEO
ðŸ”¸Logging & Monitoring            |ðŸ”¸Databases/Caching   
  - Error logging, user tracking, |   - HTTP cachings, Apollo caching
  User activity, Feature usuage,  |   statement management(Redux, context)
ðŸ”¸Infra/capcity monitoring        |   - local storage
ðŸ”¸Security                        |   - Session storage
  - Authentication/Authorization  |   - Cookie
  - CORS, CSP                     |   - IndexedDB
ðŸ”¸Performancy & Optimization      |ðŸ”¸Testing
  - Assets optimization           |   - unit test, Intergration testing, end to end testing
  - Delivery option               |   - Jest, Cypress
  - SSR                           |
  - Service worker                |

![Client-Server Architecture](./images/client-server-arch.png)
- **ViewModel** is designed to store user interface data. The problem with MVC/MVP is that they don't distinguish between business and UI data
- The **View** is isolated from the **Model**. The **ViewModel** coordinates with the odal and provides dat to the **View**
- Many **Views** can share a single **ViewModel**; a singel **View** cannot have more than one **ViewModel**
- The **ViewModel** contains all the data ad behavior of the user interface windwo but without any of the controls used to display the user interface on the screen

## MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)

- MVVM separats the view logic from business logic
  - Business Logic
    - Change username
    - make a transaction
    - remove an item from the basket
  - View Logic
    - Close/open modal window
    - Disabel button
    - Update download status

               Pros                                      |                   Cons
---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------
- Layer seperation. Clear separation between UI(View),   | - Stepper learning curve. Harder to understand
business logic(Model), and presentation Logic(ViewModel) |   and develop
- Scalability. Easier to test, maintain and scale        | - Inexpressiveness. MVVM adds space to store presentation
                                                         |   logic but doesn't help us organize other parts of the
                                                         |   application like API requests, etc.
