|2)tell me a time when you had to say NO to a customer?|**Situation:** I was working as a customer service representative at an online travel agency, and I received a call from a customer who wanted to cancel his flight booking and get a full refund. <br> **Task:** My task was to handle the customer’s request and explain the company’s cancellation policy, which stated that cancellations made less than 24 hours before the departure time would incur a 50% penalty fee. <br> **Action:** I empathized with the customer and acknowledged his frustration, but I also explained the reason behind the policy and why we could not waive the fee. I offered him some alternatives, such as changing his flight date or destination, or transferring his booking to someone else. I also reminded him of the benefits of our loyalty program, which would give him discounts and rewards for future bookings. <br> **Result:** The customer was initially angry and insisted on getting a full refund, but after I calmly and politely explained the situation and offered him some options, he eventually agreed to change his flight date and pay a smaller fee. He also thanked me for being helpful and professional, and said he would book with us again. I was able to retain the customer and avoid losing revenue for the company.|

|2) Tell me a time when you helped a co-worker with a difficult task||
|3) Tell me about a time when you failed at work.|**Situation:** I don't like to fail, but if I do, I always take ownership, put things right, and above all, view it as an opportunity to learn, grow and develop. <br> During a challenging and exciting project at work in a previous role, I was part of a team of talented people who were working on the creaton of a new product for an important client <br> **Task:** The task required us to work together as a team and use our combbined expertise and experience to create the product for the client within very strict timescales and specifications. The project should have been a breeze, simple because we had done this type of work together many times before<br> **Action:** we started out as usual with the project manage giving the team the usual brief. I can remember thinking the brief was perhaps not clear enough for the specification requied by the client, but I chose not to say anything, which ended up being a huge mistake.<br> Part-way through the project, it became apparent we had missed a very important specification off the product, which ended up putting us two weeks behind schedule<br> **Result:** Although the client was forgiving and he allowed us additional time to complete the project, we had failed to deliver on our promises as a team. During the team debrief, I disclosed I had concerns during the initial team briefing, but I chose not to say anything. I apologized for not doing so. As a team, we learnt a lot from that experience, and moving forward the same mistake never happened again.|
