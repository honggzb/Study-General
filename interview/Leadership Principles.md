|**1. Customer Obsession 顾客至尚**|answers|
|---|---|
|1)Tell me a time when you were able to foresee a customer problem?||
|2)tell me a time when you had to say NO |**Situation**: At my previous job, we were working on a client project that was nearing its deadline. The client had a last-minute request for an additional feature that involved complex animations and interactivity on the homepage.<br>**Task**: The feature was outside the original scope and would have required significant extra work, risking our ability to meet the launch date. As the lead front-end developer, it was my responsibility to assess the feasibility and impact of such changes.<br>**Action**: I reviewed the request and determined that it would delay the project by at least two weeks. I communicated this to the client, explaining the technical challenges and the potential risks to the project timeline. I suggested that we focus on launching the website with the agreed-upon features and consider implementing the new feature in a future update.<br>**Result**: The client appreciated my honesty and the clear explanation of the situation. They agreed to proceed without the additional feature, and we successfully launched the website on time. <br>The client was pleased with the result, and we scheduled a phase two for the project to incorporate their additional requests.|
|2)tell me a time when you had to say NO|**Situation**: In my previous role as a UI developer, we were in the final stages of a major project when the marketing team approached me with a request to add several new features to the user interface.<br>**Task**: The features they requested were significant and would have required a complete overhaul of the UI. This would have delayed the project launch and potentially compromised the work we had already completed.<br>**Action**: I scheduled a meeting with the marketing team and project stakeholders to discuss the implications of their request. I explained that while their ideas were valuable, implementing them at this stage would jeopardize our deadline and the overall quality of the project. I proposed that we launch the current version on time and consider their features for future updates. I also provided a rough timeline for when we could revisit their suggestions.<br>**Result**: The stakeholders understood my perspective and agreed with my approach. We launched the project on schedule, and it was well-received by users. The marketing team’s features were later incorporated into the next phase of the project, which allowed us ample time to design, test, and perfect them|

|2) Tell me a time when you helped a co-worker with a difficult task|**Situation**: During a critical phase of a project, I noticed that one of my colleagues was struggling with integrating a complex JavaScript library that was essential for our application’s functionality.<br>**Task**: The library was quite intricate, and my colleague was new to the team and not yet familiar with some of the advanced concepts required to implement it effectively.<br>**Action**: I took the initiative to offer my assistance. I spent a couple of hours after work walking him through the library’s documentation and code examples. Together, we worked on understanding the core functionalities and how to customize them to fit our project’s needs. I also shared some tips and best practices that I had learned from my own experience with similar tasks.<br>**Result**: With the extra support, my colleague was able to successfully integrate the library, and we met our project deadline. This collaboration not only helped us complete the project on time but also strengthened our team’s camaraderie and skill set.|

The project should have been a breeze, simple because we had done this type of work together many times before<br> **Action:** we started out as usual with the project manage giving the team the usual brief. I can remember thinking the brief was perhaps not clear enough for the specification requied by the client, but I chose not to say anything, which ended up being a huge mistake.<br> Part-way through the project, it became apparent we had missed a very important specification off the product, which ended up putting us two weeks behind schedule<br> **Result:** Although the client was forgiving and he allowed us additional time to complete the project, we had failed to deliver on our promises as a team. During the team debrief, I disclosed I had concerns during the initial team briefing, but I chose not to say anything. I apologized for not doing so. As a team, we learnt a lot from that experience, and moving forward the same mistake never happened again.|

Unfortunately, I made a foolish mistake and failed to consult a colleague of mine who I needed to carry out some development work on the project.<br>After I'd submitted my proposal and it was accepted, I learned that my colleague was on holiday for that period. <br>To ensure the project was still completed, I contacted a colleague from my network of software engineers and he agreed to carry out the development work for me.<br>**RESULT**: Although the project was still completed, I learned a lot from that experience and now make sure I double check my action plans and work schedules before submitting them|
|4) Tell me about a time when you had to solve a complex code problem|**Situation**:In a previous software engineering position, I worked on coding problems for an internal department. An inexperienced software engineer had created the code but was on annual leave, so I could not contact him to discuss the issue.<br> **Task**: Therefore, I had to use a common sense approach to solving the problem. The most common errors junior software engineers unwittingly make are syntax and logic. <br> **Action:** Because the system was generating a wrong solution, I presumed it was a logic error, and after further investigation, I confirmed this was the issue. <br> **Result**: Once the problem had been rectified, I emailed the junior software engineer to explain the problem I had found and advised him on how to prevent it from reoccurring. I recommended that he break down his code into small, manageable chunks and then test it before progressing to the next.|
