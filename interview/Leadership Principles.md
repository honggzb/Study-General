|---|---|
|1)Tell me a time when you were able to foresee a customer problem?||
|2)tell me a time when you had to say NO to a customer?|**Situation:** I was working as a customer service representative at an online travel agency, and I received a call from a customer who wanted to cancel his flight booking and get a full refund. <br> **Task:** My task was to handle the customer’s request and explain the company’s cancellation policy, which stated that cancellations made less than 24 hours before the departure time would incur a 50% penalty fee. <br> **Action:** I empathized with the customer and acknowledged his frustration, but I also explained the reason behind the policy and why we could not waive the fee. I offered him some alternatives, such as changing his flight date or destination, or transferring his booking to someone else. I also reminded him of the benefits of our loyalty program, which would give him discounts and rewards for future bookings. <br> **Result:** The customer was initially angry and insisted on getting a full refund, but after I calmly and politely explained the situation and offered him some options, he eventually agreed to change his flight date and pay a smaller fee. He also thanked me for being helpful and professional, and said he would book with us again. I was able to retain the customer and avoid losing revenue for the company.|
|**2. Ownership 主人翁精神**|answers|
|1) Tell me a time when you thought you were going to miss a project or task deadline|**SITUATION** : In my last software engineer position, I volunteered to continue the work of a co-worker who was on leave for several weeks. <br>We were both working on separate time-sensitive projects, but I saw this as an opportunity to help him and the company during a busy period.<br>**TASK**: It was my task to prioritize the workload for both projects to ensure the competing deadlines were met.<br>**ACTION**: I was using a Gantt chart for my project, so I set up another one for my co-workers to assess priorities and measure progress during the two-week period.<br> This proved to be a brilliant idea because I quickly determined there were identical tasks across both projects that could be completed concurrently.For the tasks requiring separate time allocation, <br>I drew up a list of the priorities, blocked out all distractions, and worked quickly and efficiently.<br>**RESULT**: By being organized, analyzing tasks for both projects, and creating a priorities list, I could make excellent progress on both projects while my co-worker was on leave.|
|2) Tell me a time when you helped a co-worker with a difficult task||
|3) Tell me about a time when you failed at work.|**Situation**: I don't like to fail, but if I do, I always take ownership, put things right, and above all, view it as an opportunity to learn, grow and develop. <br> During a challenging and exciting project at work in a previous role, I was part of a team of talented people who were working on the creaton of a new product for an important client <br> **Task:** The task required us to work together as a team and use our combbined expertise and experience to create the product for the client within very strict timescales and specifications. The project should have been a breeze, simple because we had done this type of work together many times before<br> **Action:** we started out as usual with the project manage giving the team the usual brief. I can remember thinking the brief was perhaps not clear enough for the specification requied by the client, but I chose not to say anything, which ended up being a huge mistake.<br> Part-way through the project, it became apparent we had missed a very important specification off the product, which ended up putting us two weeks behind schedule<br> **Result:** Although the client was forgiving and he allowed us additional time to complete the project, we had failed to deliver on our promises as a team. During the team debrief, I disclosed I had concerns during the initial team briefing, but I chose not to say anything. I apologized for not doing so. As a team, we learnt a lot from that experience, and moving forward the same mistake never happened again.|
|3) Tell me about a time when you had to solve a complex code problem|**Situation:**In a previous software engineering position, I worked on coding problems for an internal department. An inexperienced software engineer had created the code but was on annual leave, so I could not contact him to discuss the issue.<br> **Task:** Therefore, I had to use a common sense approach to solving the problem. The most common errors junior software engineers unwittingly make are syntax and logic. <br> **Action:** Because the system was generating a wrong solution, I presumed it was a logic error, and after further investigation, I confirmed this was the issue. <br> **Result:** Once the problem had been rectified, I emailed the junior software engineer to explain the problem I had found and advised him on how to prevent it from reoccurring. I recommended that he break down his code into small, manageable chunks and then test it before progressing to the next.|
|3) Tell me about a time when you had to solve a complex code problem|**Situation:** I was working as a software engineer at ABC Inc., and I was assigned to develop a feature that would allow users to upload and edit images on our website.<br> **Task:** The challenge was to implement a fast and efficient algorithm that could handle different types of images and formats, and also provide various editing options such as cropping, resizing, rotating and applying filters.<br> **Action:** <br> I decided to use a combination of HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript to create a responsive and interactive user interface. I also used a library called ImageMagick to perform the image processing operations on the server side. <br>I wrote clean and modular code that followed the best practices and standards of web development. I also tested and debugged my code using various tools and methods, such as unit testing, integration testing and browser compatibility testing.<br>**Result:**I successfully completed the feature within the deadline and met all the requirements and specifications. The feature was well received by the users and the clients, and it increased the traffic and engagement on our website. <br>I also received positive feedback from my manager and peers for my work.|
