|What are your weaknesses?|I have trouble asking for help & may overcommit or refrain from delgating, even though I am burning out.

While I do enjoy working independently, <br>I have been able to produce high-quality work when I'm able to pull others in and collaborate.<br>I sometimes lack confidence which can prevent me from speaking up or contributing in a meeting or conversation. I have been intentional about voicing my ideas an optnions in meetings when I feel it is appropriate and will add value. <br>Because of this, my team ended up running with my idea for managing customer inquiries, and our customer satisfaction ratings increased from 89% to 98%|
