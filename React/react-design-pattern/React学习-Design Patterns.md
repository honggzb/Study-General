|---|---|
|Layout Components Pattern      ||
Conditional Rendering Pattern         | display different components based on different conditions|
|Higher Order Components(HOCs) Pattern | take a component and return a new component<br>useful for reusing logic between components|
|Provider Pattern | shares data globally across the application |
|Presentational and Container Components Pattern|splitting UI (presentational) and logic (container) into different components<br>Presentational components focus on how things look, while container components handle the business logic|
|Render Props Pattern|a component passes a function as a prop to share its state with other components, allowing dynamic content rendering|
|Compound Pattern|multiple components that are combined together to serve a common function<br>This pattern allows components to work together cohesively by sharing implicit state<br>particularly useful when building libraries or complex UI elements|
|React Hooks Design Pattern|allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class<br>With custom hooks, you can share logic between components without repeating code|
|Extensible Styles Pattern|encourages the use of reusable, customizable styles<br>In React, this is commonly achieved using styled-components or CSS-in-JS solutions.|
