You are a senior Python developer and children’s edtech designer.
Build a desktop app called “Mini Med Lab (Kids)” for ages 6–12 to explore the human body in a gentle, fun, and safe way.

Core principles
- Kid-safe visuals (cartoony meshes, no gore/blood, bright colors).
- Big buttons, icon-first UI, short text + optional narration.
- Bilingual support EN/AR with simple vocabulary (toggle in settings).
- Runs 100% offline on Windows/Mac/Linux.

Tech stack
- UI: PySide6 (Qt) with a dark-on-pastel color theme, large touch-friendly controls.
- 3D: PyVista (VTK) for smooth, interactive cartoons (prefer PyVista over visvis).
- Audio: pyttsx3 for text-to-speech narration (offline).
- Data: JSON bundles for labels, tips, and quiz items.
- Math: NumPy for basic animations.

Features
1) Home screen with 6 big “Body Systems” cards:
   - Heart & Blood, Lungs & Breathing, Brain & Nerves, Bones, Muscles, Digestive.
2) 3D Play View (per system):
   - Shows one simplified, friendly 3D organ/mesh (e.g., a beating heart sphere with valves hinted by colors; lungs that gently inflate; brain with sparkly neuron glow).
   - Camera orbit, reset view, fullscreen button.
   - “Tap to Learn” stickers: kids click glowing pins to reveal **short fact cards** (max 2 lines, 12–16 words).
   - TTS Narrate button reads each fact in the selected language.
3) Mini-Games (per system):
   - **Label Match**: drag-and-drop labels (e.g., “Heart”, “Left Lung”) onto the 3D scene; snap with a happy sound.
   - **Build-a-Body Puzzle**: drop cartoon organs onto a torso silhouette; success = confetti + sticker reward.
   - **Healthy Habits**: choose the good habit (e.g., “Drink water” vs. “Skip sleep”).
4) Rewards:
   - Earn stickers (PNG) and keep them in a “My Lab Book” page (local JSON save).
5) Safety & Parents:
   - “Grown-ups” panel: learning goals, age range, offline note, accessibility, and disclaimers:
     “Educational use only—NOT for diagnosis or treatment.”
6) Accessibility:
   - Colorblind-friendly palette; all buttons have icons + text; narration toggle; text size slider.

3D implementation notes
- Generate meshes programmatically so the app runs without external files:
  - Heart: sphere + small colored “valve” caps; scale Y sinusoidally (beat).
  - Lungs: two ellipsoids; periodic scale + subtle color shift while “breathing”.
  - Brain: smoothed noise surface; sparkle shader effect via point sprites.
  - Bones: cylinder + spheres (cartoon long bone).
- Provide camera presets (front, left, top) as large buttons.
- Pin locations come from system JSON (normalized units); show glowing Billboard markers.

Mini-games details
- Label Match:
  - Show 3–6 draggable tokens; when dropped near a pin, auto-snap and play “ding”.
  - Score +1 per correct; 60s timer optional.
- Body Puzzle:
  - 2D torso silhouette on the side; draggable organs; magnet zones; confetti on complete.
- Healthy Habits:
  - 5–8 multiple-choice cards; immediate feedback and a short tip.

Localization (EN/AR)
- Simple bilingual JSON; include transliteration for tricky terms.
- UI must flip layout to RTL for Arabic (use Qt layout direction switch).
- TTS: if AR voice unavailable, fall back to on-screen text only.

Settings
- language: "en" | "ar"
- narration: true/false
- text_scale: 1.0–1.6
- difficulty: "junior" (6–8) | "senior" (9–12) → controls number of labels per game.

Quality & Safety
- No personal data; only local JSON saves.
- Clear “Educational only” banner.
- Graceful error dialogs (missing TTS, older GPUs).
- Unit tests for content loading, saves, and basic mesh generation.

Deliverables
- Working app with generated meshes and sample EN/AR content so it runs immediately.
- README with one-line install:
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  `python main.py`
- Include 12–18 kid-friendly facts per system (short, warm, encouraging).

Stretch goals (optional)
- Simple quiz export (PDF of earned stickers).
- Music toggle with soft loop.
- Screenshot button for kids to save their favorite view.
