## Module 1: Cloud Concepts(15-20%)

### Cloud Computing Considerations

- Cloud services that meet business needs
- On-premises system/data cloud migration
- Technical expertise of IT staff
- Total cost of ownership(TCO)
- Data privacy and laws/regulations

**BYOL**- allows cloud customers to reuse existing software licenses

### Cloud computing terms(Exam tips)

terms| explanation | meaning in Azure
---|---|---
High availability|to keep services up and running for long periods of time, while experiencing little to no downtime|VMs can spin up fast to help processs requests
Scalability|to increase or decrease resources for a given workload|scaling out(add resources to service a workload) or scaling up(add additional capabilities to handle increases in demand)
Elasticity| to automatically or dynamically increase/decrease resources as necessary/to quickly increase/decrease computer processing and resources
Agility| to react quickly. Cloud services can allocate/deallocate resources quickly| to rapidly develop, test and launch software applications
Fault tolerance| to remain up & running even if a component or service is no longer functioning| ensure you have zero downtime for services provided by Azure
Disaster recovery|to recover from a cloud service outrage|uses time-to-recovery and recovery point metrics to recover from tornadoes, floods and more
Predictive Cost|to predict what costs will be incurred for a paritcular cloud sevice or offering

- **High availability** means VMs can spin up fast to help processs requests
- **Fault tolerance** describes how Azure will ensure you have zero downtime for services provided by Azure
- **Disaster recovery** uses time-to-recovery and recovery point metrics to recover from tornadoes, floods and more
- **Scalability** refers to scaling out or scaling up
- **Elasticity** is the ability to quickly increase or decrease computer processing and resources
- **Agility** means to the ability to rapidly develop, test and launch software applications

### Economies of scale

- **CapEx** (Capital Expenditure):
  - Money spend by a business or organization on acquiring or maintaining fixed assets, such as land, buildings and equipment
  - large upfront investments
- **OpEx** (Operational Expenditure):
  - cloud computing with a pay-as-you-go model
  - An ongoing cost fro running a product, business, or system on a day-to-day basic, including annual costs
  - purchase products or services as-needed
- **Consumption-based**
  - no upfront costs
  - costly infrastruture not needed
  - pay for additional resources as-needed
  - stop paying for resources that no longer needed
- **exam Tips**
  - CapEx: buying hardware outright, paid upfront as a one time purchase
  - OpEx:  ongoing costs needed to run your business
  - Consumption-based: pricing let's you pay only for what you use

[back to top](#top)

**Virtual machine Scale Sets**

- Scale Sets are a group of identical, can be activated or deactivated as needed,
- load balanced VMs
- Benefits
  - simple to manage multiple VMs using a load balancer
  - High availability: if one VM fails or stops, the others in the scale set will keep working
  - Auto scaling
  - Large scale: run up to 1000 Vms in a single scle set
  - No extra cost, you only pay for the VM, storage and networ king resources you use. Nothing additional for scale sets

#### Azure Container Instances

- Containers
  - Containers reference the operating system of the host environment that runs the container
  - Unlike virtual machines you do not manage the operating system.
  - Containers are lightweight and are designed to be created, scaled out, and stopped dynamically.
  - Containers allows you to respond to changes on demand and quickly restart in case of a crash or hardware interruption.
  - Azure supports Docker containers.
- Container Instances
  - PaaS
  - Azure Kubernetes Service
    - open source tool for orchestrating and managing many container images and applications
    - uses clusters and pods to scale and deploy application
- Containers have less overhead than VM and can be deployed consistently

#### App Service

- managed platform to host your application
- Web App, Containers and API
- support a lot of programming languages

#### Serverless compute

- Serverless computing is the abstraction of servers, infrastructure, and OSs. With serverless computing, Azure takes care of managing the server infrastructure and allocation/deallocation of resources based on demand
  - serverless Azure offering
  - a function does one compute action each time it is invoked
- Azure has two implementations of serverless compute:
  - **Azure Functions** which can execute code in almost any modern language
  - **Azure Logic Apps** which are designed in a web-based designer and can execute logic triggered by Azure services without writing any code

### Networking

![azure-networking](https://github.com/honggzb/Study-General/blob/master/AWS/images/azure-networking.png)

#### Azure Virtual Networks(Vnets)

- Virtual Network is a fundamental part of Azure Infrastructure
- Vnet is a single region and single subscription
  - **regions:** A Vnet belongs to a single region. Every resource on the Vnet must be in the same region
  - **Subscriptions:** a Vnet belongs to just one subscription, but a subscriptiion can have multiple Vnets
- Managed via the portal, CLI or Powershell
- How to determination deployment
  - Vnet location(region)
  - IPv4 CIDR notation
    - 10.1.0.0/16,
    - 10.1 -> network of this Vnet
  - Firewalls and DDos protection
- Advantages
  - Isolate deployed Azure resources
  - VNets can link to other VNets(peering)
  - VNets can link to an on-premised networdk
  - VNet DNS can be customized
  - Private and public IP address
  - Vnets in the cloud can scale, have high availability and isolation
- Azure Virtual **Subnets**
  - are assigned a NSG(network Security Group) and route table
  - Subnet IP address range must fall within the parent VNet range
  - Subnet IP address range can be changed at any time

#### Azure Virtual Networks Management

- GUI
- CLI command
  - `az network vnet --help`
  - `az network vnet create --help`
  - `az network vnet create -g rg1 -n EastVnet2 --address-prefix 14.1.0.0/16 --subnet-name Subnet1 --subnet-prefix 14.1.1.0/24`
  - `az network vnet list | find "name"`
- PowerShell cmdlets
  - `$vnet=new-azvirtualnetwork -resourcegroupname rg1 -location canadaeast 0name EastVnet3 -addressprfix 15.1.0.0/16`
  - `$subnet=add-azvirtualnetworksubnetconfig -name Subnet1 -addressprefix 15.1.1.0/24 -virtualnetwork $vnet`
  - `$vnet|set-azvirtualnetwork`

#### Azure IP addressing

- Allow different service to communicate
- Types - Public/Private address
  - Public address
    - IPv4 or IPv6
    - static and dynamic allocation
    - allows incoming/outgoing internet connection
    - Public IPv6 - public-facing load balances only
  - Private address
    - IPv4 or IPv6
    - static and dynamic allocation
    - Allocated or set from the Vnet subnet IP range
    - used within a VNet or VPN/ExpressRoute
- Allocation - Dynamic/Static IP address
  - Dynamic IP address
    - IP address is released when resource is stopped or deleled(Such as VM stop/start)
    - Useful when the IP address does not have to remain the same
  - Static IP address
    - IP address stays with the resource until it is deleted
    - Useful when the IP address must remain the same
    - Static IPs are assigned by azure from an address pool

#### Load Balancer

- Load balancer distributes new inbound flows that arrive on the load balancer's frontend to backend pool instances, according to **rules** and **health probes**
  - inbound Flows: traffic from the internet or local network
  - FrontEnd: the access point for the load balancer. All traffic goes here first
  - Backend Pool: The VM instances receiving traffic
  - **Rules & Health Probes:** Checks to ensure backend instance can receive the data
- Scenarios
  - Internet Traffic: balance the load of incoming internet traffic into a system or application
  - Internal Networks: a load balancer works well with internal application
  - Port Forwarding: traffic can be forwarded to a specific machine in the backend pool
  - Outbound traffic: allow outbound connectivity for backend pool VMs

#### Azure VPN Gateway

- VPN Gateway are instrumental in a hybrid cloud architecture
- A VPN Gateway is a specific Vnet Gateway. It consists of two or more dedicated VMs.
- Sends encrypted data through encrypted tunnel between two endpoints
  - Vnet to Vnet
  - On-premises network to Vnet
- need to define **gateway subnet** in Azure virtual network
  - the subnet must be named **'GatewaySubnet'**
  - two VMs which not directly manageable
  - or don not deploy additional resources to the gateway subnet
- Types
  - **Point-to-point**
    - SSTP an IPsec protocol
    - VPN device not required
    - Single device VPN connection
    - Useful for travelling users
      - Secure access to Azure
  - **Site-to-site**
    - IPsec protocol
    - On-premise to Vnet
      - need VPN device
      - Windows RRAS
      - Public-facing IPv4 address
    - no VPN device if it is Vnet to Vnet
- Configuration
  - Point-to-site
    1. create a gateway subnet
    2. create Virtual network gateway
    3. PKI certificate   <- client connect to point-to-site VPN need PKI authenticate
    4. ...

#### Azure Application Gateway

- Load balanceer for web application traffic, it works on the **HTTP** request of the traffic
- difference with traditional load balance
  - traditional load balance -> traffic is routed based on **IP address and port**
  - Azure application gateway -> trafic routing based on **URL path routing**
- Benefits of using Azure Application Gateway over a simple load balancer
  - Session/Cookie affinity: can maintain a user session on the same back-end server
  - SSL termination
  - Web application Firewall(WAF)
    - Firewall designed to block web application exploits
    - cross-site request forgeries
    - directory traversal
    - cross-site scripting
    - SQL injection
  - URL rule-based routes: allow to route traffic based on URL partterns, source IP address and port to destination IP address and port(CDN)
  - Rewrite HTTP headers
- Support auto-scaling, end-to-end encryption, zone redundancy and multisite hosting
- Configuration
  - Private
  - Public

#### Content Delivery Networks(CDNs)

- a strategy we can employ in Azure to make sure that content is available to users locally
- cache content of Geographical POP(Point Of Presence) servers, Speed up end-user content delivery experience
- Features
  - Geo-filtering
  - Content compression
  - Caching rules:
  - Site acceleration
