#### Blob storage

- Users and client applications can access objects in Blob storage via HTTP/HTTPS, Azure REST API, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI or Azure storage client library
- Designed for
  - Serving image or documents directly to a browser
  - Storing files for distributed access
  - Streaming video and audio
  - writing to log files
  - Storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving
  - Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service
- Scale up or down using Hot, Cool, Archive, or Premium Storage
- Features
  - Strong consistency
  - Object mutability
  - Multiple blob types: BLock, page and append blobs
  - Easy-to-use, geo-redundancy
- Three types of resources
  - ![types-of-resources](https://github.com/honggzb/Study-General/blob/master/Cloud-study/images/types-of-resources.png)   ![Properites-of-Blob](https://github.com/honggzb/Study-General/blob/master/Cloud-study/images/Properites-of-Blob.png)
  - A storage account can include an unlimited number of containers, and a container can store an umlimited number of blobs
  - `http://{account}.blob.core.windows.net/{container}/{blobname}`
  - Storage Accounts: unique namespace in Azure for your data
    - ![storage-account](https://github.com/honggzb/Study-General/blob/master/Cloud-study/images/storage-account.png)
  - Containers: organizes a set of blobs (directory)
  - types of Blobs
    - Block blobs: store text and binary data
    - Append blobs: made up fofblocks like block blobs, but are optimized for append operations, ideal for scenarios such as logging data from VM
    - Page blobs: store random access files up to 8 TB in size. Store the VHD(Virtual Hard Drive) files serve as disks for Azure VM.
- Moving data to Blob
  - AZCopy
  - Azure storage Data Movement library(.Net library)
  - Azure Data Factory
  - Blobfuse:  Linux
  - Azure Data Box Disk: a serve for transferring on-promises data to blob storage when large datasets or network constraints make uploading data over the wire unrealistic
  - Azure Import/Export service:  export large amounts of data from storage account to hard drives that you provide and that microsoft then ships back to you with your data
