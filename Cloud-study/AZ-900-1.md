## Cloud Concepts

### The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing

- Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction

### Cloud computing service

- computer power = VMs + Hypervisor +hardware
- storage
- networking
- analytics

### Cloud computing characteristics

- Broad access
- Resource pooling
- Rapid elasticity
- self-provisioning
- metered usage

### Benefits of Cloud computing

- Cost-effective
- Scalability
- Elasticity
- Current/Updated
- Reliable(fault colerance)

## Key Concepts and Terms

- High Availability: very little downtime depending on the service in question
- Scalability:  the ability to increase or decrease resources for any given workload
- Elasticity:   the ability to automatically or dynamically increase or decrease the resources as needed
- Agility:  the ability to react quickly
- Fault tolerance: the ability to remain up and running even in the event of component or service failure
- Disaster Recovery:
- Global Reach:
- Customer Latency capability: Cloud service have the ability to deploy resources and data centers around the globe so thereby it will be addressing customers latency issues
- Predictive cost considerations:
- Techinical skill requirements
- Increased Productivity
- Security

### Type of Cloud Models

- Pulic Cloud
- Private Cloud
- Hybrid Cloud

### Types of Cloud Services

 Type|Terms | User
 ---|---|---
IaaS | Infrastructure As A Service |System administrator
PaaS | Platform As A Service  | Developer
SaaS | Software As A Service | cmd users

### Capex vs. Opex

- Capex(capital expenditure)
  - is a business expense incurred to create future benefit
  - Capex are expenditures creating future benefits. A capital expenditure is incurred when a business spends money either to buy fixed assets or to add to the value of an existing asset with a useful life that extends beyond the tax year.
- Opex(operational expenditure)
  - Opex is the money the business spends in order to turn inventory into throughput. Operating expenses also include depreciation of plants and machinery which are used in the production process
  - refers to expenses incurred in the course of ordinary business, such as sales, general and administrative expenses (and excluding cost of goods sold - or COGS, taxes, depreciation and interest)

## Module 1: Cloud Concepts(15-20%)

### Economies of scale

- CapEx (Capital expenditure)
- OpEx (operational expenditure)

### Cloud Models

models|characteristics
---|---
Public Cloud | owned by, operated by, maintained by Cloud Providers
Private Cloud | owned by, operated by, maintained by organizations that uses resources from that cloud
Hybrid Cloud | such as hosting a website in public cloud and linking it to highly secure database

### Cloud Computing Considertaions

- Cloud services that meet business needs
- On-premises system/data cloud migration
- Technical expertise of IT staff
- Total cost of ownership(TCO)
- Data privacy and laws/regulations

**BYOL**- allows cloud customers to reuse existing software licenses

## Module 2: Core Azure Services(30-35%)

### Azure Architectural Components

#### Azure Regions

- Geograhical location consisting of one or more AZs
- Charactoristic
  - Geographical
  - 60 regions, 140 countries
  - Undisclosed Azure government regions
- Special regions
  - US DOD: Central/Viginia/lowa
  - China:  East/Norht
  - Germany: Central/North east
- https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/regions/

#### Regional Pairs

#### Availability Zones(AZs)

- Within a Azure region
  - normally at least three AZs
- One or more data centers with high-speed network links
- **Azure service Availability**
  - varies by region: always changes

### Azure Solutions

### Azure Management Tools

### Azure Service and products
