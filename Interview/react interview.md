## The Virtual DOM (VDOM) 

is an in-memory representation of Real DOM. The representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the "real" DOM. It's a step that happens between the render function being called and the displaying of elements on the screen. This entire process is called **reconciliation**.

## higher-order component (HOC) 

is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. Basically, it's a pattern that is derived from React's compositional nature.

## lazy function

- React.lazy function supports default exports only
- `const SomeComponent = lazy(() => import("./IntermediateComponent.js"))`
