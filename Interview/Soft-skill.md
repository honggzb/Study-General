## Here are some key steps to determine if your code is ready for deployment:

- Functionality and Requirements:
Ensure that the code meets the specified requirements and functional expectations.
Verify that all features work as intended and edge cases are handled appropriately.
- Code Review:
  - Conduct a thorough code review. Collaborate with peers or senior developers to identify issues, bugs, and potential improvements.
  - Address any feedback received during the review process.
- Unit Tests and Test Coverage:
  - Write comprehensive unit tests for critical components.
  - Verify that the test coverage is sufficient to catch potential regressions.
  - Run tests locally and on a continuous integration (CI) server.
- Performance and Optimization:
  - Profile the code for performance bottlenecks.
  - Optimize critical sections, database queries, and resource-intensive operations.
  - Ensure the application responds quickly and efficiently.
  - Security and Vulnerabilities:
  - Check for security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and authentication flaws.
  - Use security tools like OWASP ZAP or Snyk to scan for known vulnerabilities.
- Documentation:
  - Write clear and concise documentation for the codebase.
  - Include information on how to set up the project, configuration details, and any relevant APIs.
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT):
  - Involve stakeholders or end-users in UAT.
  - Confirm that the application behaves as expected from a user‚Äôs perspective.
- Deployment and Rollback Plan:
  - Prepare a deployment plan, including steps for deploying to production.
  - Have a rollback plan in case of unexpected issues post-deployment.
- Environment-Specific Configuration:
  - Ensure that environment-specific configurations (e.g., database connections, API keys) are correctly set for production.
- Monitoring and Logging:
  - Set up monitoring tools (e.g., New Relic, Prometheus) to track application performance in production.
  - Implement logging to capture errors and debug information.
- Version Control and Tagging:
  - Commit your changes to version control (e.g., Git).
  - Tag the release with an appropriate version number (e.g., semantic versioning).
- Communication with Team and Stakeholders:
  - Inform the team and stakeholders that the task is ready for deployment.
  - Coordinate with the operations team for the actual deployment.
- Remember that shipping code is a collaborative effort, and thoroughness at each stage ensures a successful release! üöÄüë©‚Äçüíª

## How do you ensure the quality and maintainability of your code

1. I follow the best practices and coding standards for front end development, such as using semantic HTML, modular CSS, and ES6 syntax. 
2. I also use tools such as ESLint, Prettier, and Stylelint to enforce consistent code formatting and linting rules. I use Git and GitHub for version control and code collaboration. 
3. I also use code reviews and pull requests to get feedback and suggestions from other developers. 
4. I document my code using comments and JSDoc annotations. 
5. I also use tools such as Webpack and Babel to transpile, bundle, and minify my code for production

## Describe an experience having worked with a team to evolve a legacy system incrementally - what did you do to design and execute the evolution?

One of the projects that I worked on as a Front End Developer was to evolve a legacy system that was used by a larg financial System. The system was a monolithic application that handled various aspects of Portfolio management, such as account, assets, workflow. However, the system was becoming difficult to maintain, scale, and update, as it was built with outdated technologies and had a lot of technical debt.

My team and I decided to adopt a react MVVM architecture, where we make codes loosely coupled, maintainable and easy. This would allow us to modernize the system incrementally, without disrupting the existing functionality or user experience. We also wanted to migrate the system to the cloud, to leverage the benefits of scalability, reliability, and cost-efficiency.

To design and execute the evolution, we followed these steps:

1. Analyze the existing system and identify the core business domains and functionalities that can be separated into microservices or modules. Prioritize the most critical and frequently used features, and plan to migrate them first.
2. We created a new interface for the legacy system, using Strangler Fig pattern, which allowed us to by gradually replacing specific pieces of functionality with new applications and services, without affecting the users. 
3. Develop the main modules using React MVVM pattern gradually, following the best practices of software engineering, such as test-driven development, continuous integration, and continuous delivery. We also set up backup and rollback plan.
4. We tested and validated the function and UI using unit testing, integration testing, performance testing, and user acceptance testing. We also collected feedback from the stakeholders and the users, and incorporated their suggestions and requirements into the next iterations of the development cycle.
5. We repeated the process for the remaining features and functionalities, until we completely replaced the legacy system with the new UI. We also documented the design and implementation of the system, and provided training and support for the maintenance and enhancement of the system.

As a result of this project, we were able to successfully evolve the legacy system into a more modern, reusable, and scalable system that improved the performance, security, and user experiences. We also reduced the cost and complexity of the system maintenance, and enabled faster and easier updates and innovations. We received positive feedback from the client and the users, and we were recognized by the management for our teamwork and achievement.
