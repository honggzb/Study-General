---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. What is Node.js? Where can you use it?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment and library to run web applications outside the client’s browser. It is used to create server-side web applications.

Node.js is perfect for data-intensive applications as it uses an asynchronous, event-driven model. You can use  I/O intensive web applications like video streaming sites. You can also use it for developing: Real-time web applications, Network applications, General-purpose applications, and Distributed systems.

## 2. Why use Node.js?

Node.js makes building scalable network programs easy. Some of its advantages include:
- It is generally fast
- It rarely blocks
- It offers a unified programming language and data type
- Everything is asynchronous 
- It yields great concurrency

## 3. How does Node.js work?

A web server using Node.js typically has a workflow that is quite similar to the diagram illustrated below. Let’s explore this flow of operations in detail.

Node.js Architecture Workflow

- Clients send requests to the webserver to interact with the web application. Requests can be non-blocking or blocking:
- Querying for data
- Deleting data 
- Updating the data
- Node.js retrieves the incoming requests and adds those to the Event Queue
- The requests are then passed one-by-one through the Event Loop. It checks if the requests are simple enough not to require any external resources
- The Event Loop processes simple requests (non-blocking operations), such as I/O Polling, and returns the responses to the corresponding clients
A single thread from the Thread Pool is assigned to a single complex request. This thread is responsible for completing a particular blocking request by accessing external resources, such as computation, database, file system, etc.

Once the task is carried out completely, the response is sent to the Event Loop that sends that response back to the client.

## 4. Why is Node.js Single-threaded?

Node.js is single-threaded for async processing. By doing async processing on a **single-thread** under typical web loads, more performance and scalability can be achieved instead of the typical thread-based implementation.

## 5. If Node.js is single-threaded, then how does it handle concurrency?

The Multi-Threaded Request/Response Stateless Model is not followed by the Node JS Platform, and it adheres to the **Single-Threaded Event Loop Model**. The Node JS Processing paradigm is heavily influenced by the JavaScript Event-based model and the JavaScript callback system. As a result, Node.js can easily manage more concurrent client requests. The event loop is the processing model's beating heart in Node.js.

## 6. Explain callback in Node.js.

A callback function is called after a given task. It allows other code to be run in the meantime and prevents any blocking.  Being an asynchronous platform, Node.js heavily relies on callback. All APIs of Node are written to support callbacks.

## 7. What are the advantages of using promises instead of callbacks?

- The control flow of asynchronous logic is more specified and structured.
- The coupling is low.
- We've built-in error handling.
- Improved readability.

## 8. How would you define the term I/O? 

- The term I/O is used to describe any program, operation, or device that transfers data to or from a medium and to or from another medium
- Every transfer is an output from one medium and an input into another. The medium can be a physical device, network, or files within a system

## 9. How is Node.js most frequently used?

Node.js is widely used in the following applications:

- Real-time chats
- Internet of Things
- Complex SPAs (Single-Page Applications)
- Real-time collaboration tools
- Streaming applications
- Microservices architecture

## 10. Explain the difference between frontend and backend development?

| Front-end | Back-end|
|---|---|
|Frontend refers to the client-side of an application|Backend refers to the server-side of an application|
|It is the part of a web application that users can see and interact with|It constitutes everything that happens behind the scenes|
|It typically includes everything that attributes to the visual aspects of a web application|It generally includes a web server that communicates with a database to serve requests|
|HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AngularJS, and ReactJS are some of the essentials of frontend development|Java, PHP, Python, and Node.js are some of the backend development technologies|


## 11. What is NPM?

- NPM stands for Node Package Manager, responsible for managing all the packages and modules for Node.js.
- Node Package Manager provides two main functionalities:
  - Provides online repositories for node.js packages/modules, which are searchable on search.nodejs.org
  - Provides command-line utility to install Node.js packages and also manages Node.js versions and dependencies 

[⬆ back to top](#top)

## 12. What are the modules in Node.js?

- Modules are like JavaScript libraries that can be used in a Node.js application to include a set of functions. To include a module in a Node.js application, use the require() function with the parentheses containing the module's name.
- Node.js has many modules to provide the basic functionality needed for a web application. Some of them include:


|Core Modules|Description|
|---|---|
|HTTP|Includes classes, methods, and events to create a Node.js HTTP server |
|util|Includes utility functions useful for developers|
|fs|Includes events, classes, and methods to deal with file I/O operations|
|url|Includes methods for URL parsing|
|query string|Includes methods to work with query string|
|stream|Includes methods to handle streaming data|
|zlib|Includes methods to compress or decompress files|

[⬆ back to top](#top)

## 13. What is the purpose of the module .Exports?

In Node.js, a module encapsulates all related codes into a single unit of code that can be parsed by moving all relevant functions into a single file. You may export a module with the module and export the function, which lets it be imported into another file with a needed keyword.

## 14. Why is Node.js preferred over other backend technologies like Java and PHP?

Some of the reasons why Node.js is preferred include:

- Node.js is very fast
- Node Package Manager has over 50,000 bundles available at the developer’s disposal
- Perfect for data-intensive, real-time web applications, as Node.js never waits for an API to return data
- Better synchronization of code between server and client due to same code base
- Easy for web developers to start using Node.js in their projects as it is a JavaScript library

## 15. What is the difference between Angular and Node.js?

|Angular|Node.js|
|---|---|
|It is a frontend development framework|It is a server-side environment|
|It is written in TypeScript|It is written in C, C++ languages|
|Used for building single-page, client-side web applications|Used for building fast and scalable server-side networking applications|
|Splits a web application into MVC components|Generates database queries|

## 16. Which database is more popularly used with Node.js?

MongoDB is the most common database used with Node.js. It is a NoSQL, cross-platform, document-oriented database that provides high performance, high availability, and easy scalability.


## 17. What are some of the most commonly used libraries in Node.js?

There are two commonly used libraries in Node.js:

- ExpressJS - Express is a flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a wide set of features to develop web and mobile applications.
- Mongoose - Mongoose is also a Node.js web application framework that makes it easy to connect an application to a database.

## 18. What are the pros and cons of Node.js?

|Node.js Pros|Node.js Cons|
|---|---|
|Fast processing and an event-based model|Not suitable for heavy computational tasks|
|Uses JavaScript, which is well-known amongst developers|Using callback is complex since you end up with several nested callbacks|
|Node Package Manager has over 50,000 packages that provide the functionality to an application|Dealing with relational databases is not a good option for Node.js|
|Best suited for streaming huge amounts of data and I/O intensive operations|Since Node.js is single-threaded, CPU intensive tasks are not its strong suit|

## 19. What is the command used to import external libraries?

The “require” command is used for importing external libraries. For example - “var http=require (“HTTP”).”  This will load the HTTP library and the single exported object through the HTTP variable.

Now that we have covered some of the important beginner-level Node.js interview questions let us look at some of the intermediate-level Node.js interview questions.

## Node.js Interview Questions and Answers For Intermediate Level

## 20. What does event-driven programming mean?

An event-driven programming approach uses events to trigger various functions. An event can be anything, such as typing a key or clicking a mouse button. A call-back function is already registered with the element executes whenever an event is triggered.

## 21. What is an Event Loop in Node.js?

Event loops handle asynchronous callbacks in Node.js. It is the foundation of the non-blocking input/output in Node.js, making it one of the most important environmental features.

## 22. Differentiate between process.nextTick() and setImmediate()?

The distinction between method and product. This is accomplished through the use of nextTick() and setImmediate(). next Tick() postpones the execution of action until the next pass around the event loop, or it simply calls the callback function once the event loop's current execution is complete, whereas setImmediate() executes a callback on the next cycle of the event loop and returns control to the event loop for any I/O operations.

[⬆ back to top](#top)

## 23. What is an EventEmitter in Node.js?

- EventEmitter is a class that holds all the objects that can emit events
- Whenever an object from the EventEmitter class throws an event, all attached functions are called upon synchronously

```js
const EventEmitter = require('events');
class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {};
const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();
myEmitter.on('event', () => {
  console.log('an event occurred!');
});
myEmitter.emit('event');
```

## 24. What are the two types of API functions in Node.js?

The two types of API functions in Node.js are:

- Asynchronous, non-blocking functions
- Synchronous, blocking functions
- 
## 25. What is the package.json file?

The package.json file is the heart of a Node.js system. This file holds the metadata for a particular project. The package.json file is found in the root directory of any Node application or module

[⬆ back to top](#top)

## 26. How would you use a URL module in Node.js?

The URL module in Node.js provides various utilities for URL resolution and parsing. It is a built-in module that helps split up the web address into a readable format.

```js
var url = require('url');
var adrs = 'http://localhost:8080/default.htm?year=2020&month=march';
var que = url.parse(adrs, true);
console.log(que.host);      // localhost:8080
console.log(que.pathname);   // /default.htm
console.log(que.search);     // ?year=2020&month=march
var quedata = que.query;     // { year: 2020, month: 'march'}
console.log(quedata.month);  // 'march'
```

## 27. What is the Express.js package?

Express is a flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a wide set of features to develop both web and mobile applications

## 28. How do you create a simple Express.js application?

- The request object represents the HTTP request and has properties for the request query string, parameters, body, HTTP headers, and so on
- The response object represents the HTTP response that an Express app sends when it receives an HTTP request

[⬆ back to top](#top)

## 29. What are streams in Node.js?

Streams are objects that enable you to read data or write data continuously. There are four types of streams:

- Readable – Used for reading operations
- Writable − Used for write operations
- Duplex − Can be used for both reading and write operations
- Transform − A type of duplex stream where the output is computed based on input

## 30. How do you install, update, and delete a dependency?


## 31. How do you create a simple server in Node.js that returns Hello World?

- Import the HTTP module
- Use createServer function with a callback function using request and response as parameters.
- Type “hello world." 
- Set the server to listen to port 8080 and assign an IP address

[⬆ back to top](#top)

## 32. Explain asynchronous and non-blocking APIs in Node.js.

- All Node.js library APIs are asynchronous, which means they are also non-blocking
- A Node.js-based server never waits for an API to return data. Instead, it moves to the next API after calling it, and a notification mechanism from a Node.js event responds to the server for the previous API call

## 33. How do we implement async in Node.js?

As shown below, the async code asks the JavaScript engine running the code to wait for the request.get() function to complete before moving on to the next line for execution.

async

## 34. What is a callback function in Node.js?

A callback is a function called after a given task. This prevents any blocking and enables other code to run in the meantime.

In the last section, we will now cover some of the advanced-level Node.js interview questions.

Node.js Interview Questions and Answers For Experienced Professionals
This section will provide you with the Advanced Node.js interview questions which will primarily help experienced professionals.

## 35. What is REPL in Node.js?

REPL stands for Read Eval Print Loop, and it represents a computer environment. It’s similar to a Windows console or Unix/Linux shell in which a command is entered. Then, the system responds with an output

repl2

## 36. What is the control flow function?

The control flow function is a piece of code that runs in between several asynchronous function calls.

## 37. How does control flow manage the function calls?
function-calls

## 38. What is the difference between fork() and spawn() methods in Node.js?
fork()

spawn()

	spawn
fork() is a particular case of spawn() that generates a new instance of a V8 engine.

Spawn() launches a new process with the available set of commands.

Multiple workers run on a single node code base for multiple tasks.

This method doesn’t generate a new V8 instance, and only a single copy of the node module is active on the processor.

## 39. What is the buffer class in Node.js?
Buffer class stores raw data similar to an array of integers but corresponds to a raw memory allocation outside the V8 heap. Buffer class is used because pure JavaScript is not compatible with binary data

## 40. What is piping in Node.js?
Piping is a mechanism used to connect the output of one stream to another stream. It is normally used to retrieve data from one stream and pass output to another stream

## 41. What are some of the flags used in the read/write operations in files?
flags

## 42. How do you open a file in Node.js?

## 89.  Define the concept of the test pyramid. Please explain the process of implementing them in terms of HTTP APIs.
The test pyramid is a concept that is often used in software testing to illustrate the ideal distribution of different types of tests. The pyramid consists of three layers: unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. The idea is that the majority of tests should be at the unit level, with fewer tests at the integration and end-to-end levels.

To implement the test pyramid in terms of HTTP APIs, you can start by writing unit tests for each endpoint in the API. These tests should focus on testing the functionality of the endpoint in isolation without making any external requests or dependencies. Once the unit tests are passed, you can write integration tests that test the interaction between different endpoints and components in the API. Finally, you can write end-to-end tests that test the entire API, from the user interface to the database.
