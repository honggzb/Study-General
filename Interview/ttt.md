### working in an agile environment

- Active Participation in Scrum Events:
	- I actively participate in all scrum ceremonies, including daily <mark>stand-ups, sprint planning, retrospectives, and sprint reviews</mark>. For example, in daily stand-ups, I share updates on progress, address blockers, and coordinate with teammates to ensure smooth execution.
	- During <mark>sprint planning</mark>, I work with the team to break down user stories into smaller tasks, estimate effort using story points, and prioritize based on the team’s capacity and sprint goals.

- **Collaboration and Communication**:
	- Agile emphasizes collaboration, and I regularly communicate with stakeholders, product owners, and QA teams to ensure alignment with requirements and timelines.
	- Tools like Jira, Trello, or Azure DevOps are part of my workflow to track progress, update tasks, and maintain transparency within the team.
	
- **Iterative Development and Delivery**:
	- I follow a build-measure-learn approach, focusing on delivering incremental updates and gathering feedback early to adapt to changes.
	- For instance, while working on a web application, I implemented core features first in an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) format and iteratively enhanced them based on user and stakeholder feedback.
	
- **Quality Focus**:
	- I prioritize test-driven development (TDD) and collaborate with QA to incorporate automated testing pipelines for continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD).
	- Code reviews and pair programming are integral parts of my agile workflow, ensuring quality and knowledge sharing within the team.
	
- Adaptability to Change:
	- I embrace agile’s flexibility by responding to changes in priorities or scope during sprints. I ensure that changes are discussed, evaluated, and incorporated effectively without disrupting the team’s velocity.
	
- **Continuous Improvement**:
	- In <mark>retrospectives</mark>, I actively contribute to identifying bottlenecks and proposing actionable steps to improve processes, such as optimizing task handoffs or refining the definition of done.
	
- Overall, working in an agile environment has allowed me to remain adaptable, deliver value incrementally, and continuously refine both the product and the process for maximum efficiency

## A day in the life might look like:

- Collaborate with stakeholders and designers to scope, evaluate and design the technical solutions to product problems and features.
- Serve as a role model for our high engineering standards and bring consistency to our codebases and processes
- Build, maintain and iterate on our core product and features.**
