### working in an agile environment

- Active Participation in Scrum Events:
	- I actively participate in all scrum ceremonies, including daily <mark>stand-ups, sprint planning, retrospectives, and sprint reviews</mark>. For example, in daily stand-ups, I share updates on progress, address blockers, and coordinate with teammates to ensure smooth execution.
	- During <mark>sprint planning</mark>, I work with the team to break down user stories into smaller tasks, estimate effort using story points, and prioritize based on the team’s capacity and sprint goals.

- **Collaboration and Communication**:
	- Agile emphasizes collaboration, and I regularly communicate with stakeholders, product owners, and QA teams to ensure alignment with requirements and timelines.
	- Tools like Jira, Trello, or Azure DevOps are part of my workflow to track progress, update tasks, and maintain transparency within the team.
	
- **Iterative Development and Delivery**:
	- I follow a build-measure-learn approach, focusing on delivering incremental updates and gathering feedback early to adapt to changes.
	- For instance, while working on a web application, I implemented core features first in an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) format and iteratively enhanced them based on user and stakeholder feedback.
	
- **Quality Focus**:
	- I prioritize test-driven development (TDD) and collaborate with QA to incorporate automated testing pipelines for continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD).
	- Code reviews and pair programming are integral parts of my agile workflow, ensuring quality and knowledge sharing within the team.
	
- Adaptability to Change:
	- I embrace agile’s flexibility by responding to changes in priorities or scope during sprints. I ensure that changes are discussed, evaluated, and incorporated effectively without disrupting the team’s velocity.
	
- **Continuous Improvement**:
	- In <mark>retrospectives</mark>, I actively contribute to identifying bottlenecks and proposing actionable steps to improve processes, such as optimizing task handoffs or refining the definition of done.
	
- Overall, working in an agile environment has allowed me to remain adaptable, deliver value incrementally, and continuously refine both the product and the process for maximum efficiency

## A day in the life might look like:

- Collaborate with stakeholders and designers to scope, evaluate and design the technical solutions to product problems and features.
- Serve as a role model for our high engineering standards and bring consistency to our codebases and processes
- Build, maintain and iterate on our core product and features.**


## A Typical Day

1. Develop frontend features and make improvements to the Deliverect product in a secure, well-tested, and performant way. 
2. Collaborate with Product Management, Product Designers, Backend Engineers and other stakeholders to maintain a high bar for quality in a fast-paced, iterative environment. 
3. Advocate for and supervise initiatives to improve product quality, security, and performance. 
4. Craft code that meets our internal standards for style, maintainability, and best practices for a high-scale web environment. Maintain and advocate for these standards through code review. 
5. Recognise impediments to our efficiency as a team, and propose and implement solutions. 
6. Ship small to medium-sized features and improvements with minimal guidance from other team members. Collaborate with the team on larger projects. 
7. Demonstrated capacity to clearly and concisely communicate about complex technical, architectural, and organisational problems and propose thorough, iterative solutions. 
8. Effective communication skills: Regularly achieve consensus with peers and provide clear status updates. 
9. Aspiration toward building our culture of communication, inclusion, and visibility
10. Experience owning a project from concept to production, including proposal, discussion, and execution.
