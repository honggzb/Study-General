### web development principles

- user-centered design
- responsive design
- accessibility
- web standards
- usability
- visual design

### method of modern Web approach

- Progressive Web App(PWA)
- Single Page Application(SPA)
- Responsive Web Design(RWD)
- Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM):  separate an application's business and presentation logic(Model) from its user interface(View)

### SOLID Design Principles in Software Development

|Principle|explaination|
|---|---|
|Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)|a class, module, or function should have only one reason to change, meaning it should do one thing|
|Open-Closed Principle (OCP)| classes, modules, and functions should be open for extension but closed for modification|
|Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)|child classes or subclasses must be substitutable for their parent classes or super classes|
|Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)|clients should not be forced to implement interfaces or methods they do not use|
|Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)|high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Instead, they should both depend on abstractions|

### Principles in Software Development

1. DevOps
   1. Jenkins, Bamboo
   2. sonarqube- quality gate(the set of conditions a project must meet before it should be pushed to further environments)
2. Agile
3. Clean Code: 
   1. code linting/formatting:  `ng lint`
4. Quality Assurance
   1. Define quality criteria
   2. Plan the testing process
   3. Conduct functional testing
   4. Perform usability testing
   5. Conduct security testing
   6. Perform performance testing
   7. Identify and report issues
   8. Fix and retest
   9. Verify quality criteria
5. Documentation
   1. `npm run docs:serve` or `npm run docs:coverage` and verify that the documentation coverage is complete for the new code changes

### types of QA testing

|types|explaination|
|---|---|
|Functional |This type of testing checks that the website works properly and performs its intended tasks, including all features such as links, forms, buttons, and images. |
|Usability Testing|This testing ensures that the website is easy to use and navigate, checking its design, layout, and navigation to identify any areas that may be confusing or difficult to use.|
|Security Testing|This testing is done to make sure that the website is secure and protected from external threats like hacking, malware, and other security risks.|
|Performance Testing|This testing verifies that the website performs well and doesn’t have delays, checking its speed, scalability, and responsiveness to ensure that it can handle high traffic and usage. |
|Compatibility Testing|This testing checks that the website works correctly on different browsers, devices, and operating systems, verifying its compatibility with various platforms to ensure that it functions well on all devices. |
|Regression Testing|This testing makes sure that new changes or updates to the website do not negatively affect its existing features and functionality, by retesting the website’s existing features and functionality after any changes have been made. |
|Accessibility Testing|This testing ensures that the website is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, checking the website’s compatibility with assistive technologies and verifying that it meets accessibility standards and guidelines.|

What are the **common mistakes** to avoid in performing web quality assurance?

- **Not testing on different browsers and devices**: One of the most common mistakes that people make is not testing their website on different browsers and devices. It’s important to test your website on various devices, such as mobile phones, tablets, and desktop computers, to ensure that it looks and works the same way across all platforms. 
- **Not testing for accessibility**: Accessibility is an important aspect of web design, as it ensures that your website is usable by people with disabilities. You should test your website for accessibility by using screen readers, keyboard-only navigation, and other assistive technologies. 
- **Not testing for performance**: Your website’s performance is critical to its success, as slow loading times can turn visitors away. Make sure you test your website’s load times and overall performance regularly. 
- **Not testing for security**: Security is another crucial aspect of web quality assurance. You should test your website for vulnerabilities and implement security measures, such as SSL certificates, to protect your website from attacks. 
- **Not documenting issues**: When testing your website, it’s important to document any issues that you find. This helps you keep track of what needs to be fixed and ensures that you don’t forget anything.
