### [Common](#common)

[:arrow_up: Back to Top](#groups)

1. ### What is NextJS?

   Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications.

   [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#common-table-of-contents)

2. ### How do you create a new Next.js project?

   Using command

   > npx create-next-app@latest

   [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#common-table-of-contents)

3. ### What is the purpose of the `pages or app` directory in Next.js?

   It contains React components that are automatically routed based on their file name.

   [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#common-table-of-contents)

4. ### What is file based routing in Next.js?

   Routing based on the file structure in the `pages or app` directory.

   [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#common-table-of-contents)

5. ### What are the key features of Next.js?

   - Server Side Rendering (SSR): Next.js allows rendering React components on the server before sending them to the client, improving performance and SEO.
   - Static Site Generation (SSG): It pre-renders pages at build time, useful for blogs or e-commerce sites.
   - API Routes: You can build a backend using API routes in the same codebase without needing an external server.
   - File Based Routing: Next.js automatically creates routes based on the file structure inside the pages directory.
   - Client Side Rendering (CSR): Like React, Next.js also supports traditional client-side rendering.
   - Incremental Side Rendering:
   - Image Optimization: Built-in image optimization capabilities that reduce image sizes and enhance loading times.
   - Automatic Code Splitting: Next.js splits the code into smaller bundles, which are loaded only when required, improving performance.
   - TypeScript Support: Native support for TypeScript, enabling strict typing and better developer experience.
   - Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR): Pages can be statically generated at runtime and updated incrementally.
   - Fast Refresh: Provides an instant feedback loop while coding, similar to React's hot reloading.

6. ### What are the differences between Next.js and React.js

   | Feature            | Next.js                                                                                                         | React.js                                                                                               |
   | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | Rendering          | Supports Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Static Site Generation (SSG), and Client-Side Rendering (CSR).            | Only supports Client-Side Rendering (CSR) by default.                                                  |
   | Routing            | Built-in file-based routing system. Automatically generates routes based on the folder structure.               | No built-in routing. Requires libraries like React Router.                                             |
   | SEO                | Excellent for SEO as it supports SSR and SSG, allowing pre-rendered content to be indexed by search engines.    | Limited SEO capabilities due to client-side rendering. Additional work is needed for SEO optimization. |
   | Performance        | Faster initial page load due to SSR, automatic code splitting, and static generation.                           | May have slower page loads for large apps since everything is rendered on the client.                  |
   | Configuration      | Minimal configuration required. Comes with SSR, SSG, and routing out of the box.                                | Requires manual setup for SSR, routing, and other advanced features.                                   |
   | Learning Curve     | Slightly steeper due to built-in advanced features like SSR, SSG, and API routes.                               | Easier to learn initially, but requires additional tools for SSR and routing.                          |
   | API Routes         | Built-in API routes that can handle backend logic within the same project.                                      | No support for API routes; requires external tools for backend development.                            |
   | Code Splitting     | Automatically splits code into smaller bundles, loading only what's needed for a specific page.                 | Requires manual code splitting or use of lazy loading to optimize performance.                         |
   | Deployment         | Optimized for easy deployment on platforms like Vercel (creators of Next.js) and supports serverless functions. | Deployment typically requires additional configuration for optimized hosting and SSR.                  |
   | Image Optimization | Has a built-in Image component for automatic image resizing and optimization.                                   | Does not provide image optimization; developers need third-party libraries for that.                   |

   [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#common-table-of-contents)

10. ### What is the difference between push and replace in useRouter?

    The `push` method adds a new entry to the browser's history stack, while `replace` replaces the current entry in the history stack.

    ```jsx
    const router = useRouter();

    // Pushes a new route
    router.push("/new-route");

    // Replaces the current route
    router.replace("/new-route");

45. ### What is React Strict Mode in Next.js?

    A development mode only feature for highlighting potential problems in an application. It helps to identify unsafe lifecycles, legacy API usage, and a number of other features.

    ```js
    module.exports = {
      reactStrictMode: true,
    };
    ```

    **Note**: Since Next.js 13.5.1, Strict Mode is true by default with app router, so the above configuration is only necessary for pages. You can still disable Strict Mode by setting `reactStrictMode: false`.

    // This function can be marked `async` if using `await` inside
    export function middleware(request) {
      return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/home", request.url));
    }

    // See "Matching Paths" below to learn more

12. ### What is getServerSideProps?

    A function that runs on each request to fetch data for a page.

    ```jsx
    export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
      const res = await fetch(`https://...`);
      const data = await res.json();

      if (!data) {
        return {
          notFound: true,
        };
      }

      return {
        props: { data }, // will be passed to the page component as props
      };
    }
    ```

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#pages-router-table-of-contents)

13. ### What is the difference between getStaticProps and getServerSideProps?

    getStaticProps runs at build time, getServerSideProps runs on each request.

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#pages-router-table-of-contents)

14. ### What is getStaticPaths?

    A function that specifies dynamic routes to pre-render based on data.

    ```jsx
    export async function getStaticPaths() {
      const res = await fetch("https://.../posts");
      const posts = await res.json();

      // Get the paths we want to pre-render based on posts
      const paths = posts.map((post) => ({
        params: { id: post.id },
      }));

      // We'll pre-render only these paths at build time.
      // { fallback: false } means other routes should 404.
      return { paths, fallback: false };
    }
    ```

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#pages-router-table-of-contents)

15. ### What is fallback in getStaticPaths?

    Determines how to handle missing paths, with true, false, or 'blocking'.

    ```jsx
    export async function getStaticPaths() {
      const paths = await getAllPostIds();
      return {
        paths,
        fallback: true, // this will enable fallback for all paths which are not generated at build time
      };
    }
    ```

    ```jsx
    export async function getStaticPaths() {
      const paths = await getAllPostIds();
      return {
        paths,
        fallback: false, // this will return 404 for all paths which are not generated at build time
      };
    }
    ```

    ```jsx
    export async function getStaticPaths() {
      const paths = await getAllPostIds();
      return {
        paths,
        fallback: "blocking", // this will return a static page for all paths which are not generated at build time
      };
    }
    ```

        e.preventDefault();
        const formData = new FormData(e.target);
        const response = await fetch("/api/contact", {
          method: "POST",
          body: formData,
        });
        if (response.ok) {
          alert("Form submitted successfully!");
        } else {
          alert("Error submitting form.");
        }
      };

      return (

22. ### Are there any performance optimizations available in the Pages Router?

    Yes, you can use features like static generation (SSG), server-side rendering (SSR), and incremental static regeneration (ISR) to optimize performance in the Pages Router.

    - **Static Generation (SSG)**: Pre-render pages at build time.
    - **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Render pages on each request.
    - **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**: Update static pages after the build.

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#pages-router-table-of-contents)

23. ### How do you handle internationalization in Next.js with the Pages Router?

    By using the `next-i18next` library or the built-in internationalization features in Next.js.

    ```js
    // next.config.js
    module.exports = {
      i18n: {
        locales: ["en", "fr"],
        defaultLocale: "en",
      },
    };
    ```

    Then, you can use the `useTranslation` hook from `next-i18next` to handle translations in your components.

    ```jsx
    import { useTranslation } from "next-i18next";

    export default function Home() {
      const { t } = useTranslation("common");
      return <h1>{t("welcome")}</h1>;
    }
    ```

    public/
    ├── images/
    │   └── logo.png
    └── favicon.ico
    ```

    You can access these files using `/images/logo.png` or `/favicon.ico`.

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#pages-router-table-of-contents)

26. ### How cache works in Next.js with the Pages Router?

    Next.js uses a built-in caching mechanism for static assets and API routes. You can also implement custom caching strategies using HTTP headers or libraries like `next-cache`.

    - **Static Assets**: Cached by default with a long cache lifetime.
    - **API Routes**: Can be cached using HTTP headers like `Cache-Control`.

    ```js
    export default function handler(req, res) {
      res.setHeader("Cache-Control", "public, max-age=3600, immutable");
      res.status(200).json({ message: "Cached response" });
    }
    ```

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#pages-router-table-of-contents)

27. ### Cache revalidation in Next.js with the Pages Router?

    Cache revalidation can be handled using the `revalidate` option in `getStaticProps` or by setting appropriate HTTP headers in API routes.

    - **Using `revalidate`**: Automatically revalidates static pages after a specified time.

    ```jsx
    export async function getStaticProps() {
      const res = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
      const data = await res.json();

      return {
        props: { data },
        revalidate: 10, // Revalidate every 10 seconds
      };
    }
    ```

    - **Using HTTP Headers**: Set cache control headers in API routes.

    ```js
    export default function handler(req, res) {
      res.setHeader("Cache-Control", "s-maxage=10, stale-while-revalidate");
      res.status(200).json({ message: "Revalidated response" });
    }
    ```

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#pages-router-table-of-contents)

28. ### Optimizing images in Next.js with the Pages Router?

    By using the `next/image` component, which automatically optimizes images for performance.

    ```jsx
    import Image from "next/image";

    export default function Home() {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>My Next.js App</h1>
          <Image
            src="/images/logo.png"
            alt="Logo"
            width={500}
            height={300}
            quality={75}
          />
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

    The `next/image` component provides features like lazy loading, responsive images, and automatic format selection.

   The App Router is a new routing system introduced in Next.js 13 that allows for more flexible and powerful routing capabilities, including nested routes, layouts, and server components.

   [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

2. ### How do you create a route in the App Router?

   In the App Router, you create routes by adding files to the `app` directory. Each file corresponds to a route, and you can create nested routes by creating subdirectories.

   ```
   app/
   ├── page.js          // Home page
   ├── about/
   │   └── page.js      // About page
   └── blog/
       ├── page.js      // Blog index page
       └── [slug]/
           └── page.js  // Dynamic blog post page
   ```

   [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

3. ### How do you create a dynamic route with app router in Next.js?

   In the App Router, you create dynamic routes by using square brackets in the file name. For example, to create a dynamic blog post route, you would create a file named `[slug]/page.js` inside the `blog` directory.

   ```
   app/
   └── blog/
       └── [slug]/
           └── page.js  // Dynamic blog post page
   ```

          credentials: {
            username: { label: "Username", type: "text" },
            password: { label: "Password", type: "password" },
          },
          async authorize(credentials) {
            // Add your own logic to validate credentials here
            const user = { id: 1, name: "John Doe" }; // Example user

            if (
              credentials.username === "admin" &&
              credentials.password === "password"
            ) {
              return user; // Return user object if credentials are valid
            } else {
              return null; // Return null if credentials are invalid
            }
          },
        }),
      ],
      pages: {
        signIn: "/auth/signin", // Custom sign-in page
      },
      callbacks: {
        async session(session, user) {
          session.user = user; // Add user object to session
          return session;
        },
      },
      secret: process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET, // Required for JWT encryption
      session: {

11. ### What is use server in Next.js?

    The `use server` directive is used to indicate that a function should be executed on the server side. It allows you to write server-side logic in a component or function that can be called from the client side.

    ```jsx
    "use server";

    export async function myServerFunction() {
      // Server-side logic here
      return "Hello from the server!";
    }
    ```

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

12. ### Difference between using & not using use server in Next.js?

    **Using `use server`**: The function is executed on the server side, allowing access to server-side resources and APIs. It can be used to perform operations that require server-side logic, such as database queries or API calls.

    **Not using `use server`**: The function is executed on the client side, meaning it cannot access server-side resources directly. It can only perform operations that are available in the client environment, such as manipulating the DOM or making client-side API calls.

    - **Example with `use server`**:

      ```jsx
      "use server";
      export async function fetchData() {
        const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
        const data = await response.json();
        return data;
      }
      ```

    - **Example without `use server`**:

      ```jsx
      export async function fetchData() {
        const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
        const data = await response.json();
        return data;
      }
      ```

    - Example with `use server` In Component:

      ```jsx
        import { fetchData } from "./path/to/your/file";

        export default function MyComponent() {
          const data = await fetchData(); // This will run on the server side
          return <div>{data}</div>;
        }
      ```

    - Example without `use server` In Component:

      ```jsx
      import { fetchData } from "./path/to/your/file";
      export default function MyComponent() {
        const data = fetchData(); // This will run on the client side
        return <div>{data}</div>;
      }
      ```

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

13. ### How do you handle API routes in Next.js?

    By creating files in the `app/api` directory, where each file corresponds to an API endpoint.

    ```jsx
    // app/api/hello/route.js
    export async function GET(request) {
      return new Response("Hello, World!");
    }
    ```

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

14. ### How do middleware work in Next.js?

    Middleware in Next.js allows you to run code before a request is completed. You can use it to modify the request or response, redirect users, or perform authentication checks.

    ```js
    // app/middleware.js
    import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
    export function middleware(request) {
      // Perform some logic here
      if (request.nextUrl.pathname === "/") {
        return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/home", request.url));
      }
      return NextResponse.next();
    }
    ```

    You can also specify which paths the middleware should apply to:

    ```js
    // app/middleware.js
    export const config = {
      matcher: ["/about/:path*", "/blog/:path*"],
    };
    ```

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

15. ### What is form action in Next.js?

    The `formAction` is a special attribute used in Next.js to define the action URL for a form submission. It allows you to specify a server-side function that will handle the form submission.

    ```jsx
    // app/form-example/page.js
    "use server";

    export async function handleSubmit(formData) {
      const name = formData.get("name");
      console.log("Form submitted with name:", name);
      return { success: true };
    }

    export default function FormExample() {
      return (
        <form action={handleSubmit}>
          <input type="text" name="name" />
          <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
      );
    }
    ```

    In this example, when the form is submitted, the `handleSubmit` function will be called on the server side with the form data.

16. ### How do you handle file uploads in Next.js?

    By using the `formData` API in a server action to handle file uploads.

    ```jsx
    // app/upload/page.js
    "use server";

    export async function handleUpload(formData) {
      const file = formData.get("file");
      // Process the file (e.g., save it to a storage service)
      console.log("File uploaded:", file.name);
      return { success: true };
    }

    export default function UploadPage() {
      return (
        <form action={handleUpload} encType="multipart/form-data">
          <input type="file" name="file" />
          <button type="submit">Upload</button>
        </form>
      );
    }
    ```

17. ### Mention some common use cases for the App Router in Next.js.

    - Creating nested routes with layouts.
    - Implementing server-side rendering for dynamic content.
    - Handling API routes for backend functionality.
    - Managing authentication and authorization flows.
    - Building complex applications with shared layouts and components.

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

18. ### One of the main differences between the App Router and Pages Router in Next.js?

    The App Router allows for nested routes, layouts, and server components, while the Pages Router uses a flat file structure for routing and does not support nested routes or layouts.

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

19. ### What is the use of the `use client` directive in Next.js?

    The `use client` directive is used to indicate that a component should be rendered on the client side. It allows you to write client-side logic in a component that can be executed in the browser.

    ```jsx
    "use client";

    export default function ClientComponent() {
      return <div>This component is rendered on the client side.</div>;
    }
    ```

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

20. ### Is it possible to use both App Router and Pages Router in the same Next.js project?

    Yes, it is possible to use both App Router and Pages Router in the same Next.js project. You can have the `app` directory for the App Router and the `pages` directory for the Pages Router, allowing you to take advantage of both routing systems.

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

21. ### Are there any limitations of the App Router in Next.js?

    Yes, some limitations of the App Router include:

    - It is only available in Next.js 13 and later versions.
    - It may not support all features available in the Pages Router.
    - Some third-party libraries may not be compatible with the App Router.
    - Many features from the Pages Router, such as `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps`, are not available in the App Router.
    - The App Router is still evolving, and some features may change or be added in future releases.

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

22. ### Explain the concept of authorization in middleware & routes in Next.js.

    Authorization in middleware and routes in Next.js involves checking if a user has the necessary permissions to access a specific route or perform an action. This can be done by verifying user roles, permissions, or tokens in the middleware function before allowing access to the route.

    ```js
    // app/middleware.js
    import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

    export function middleware(request) {
      const token = request.cookies.get("authToken");

      if (!token) {
        return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/login", request.url));
      }

      // Additional authorization logic can go here

      return NextResponse.next();
    }

    export const config = {
      matcher: ["/protected/:path*"], // Apply middleware to protected routes
    };
    ```

    In this example, the middleware checks for an authentication token in the cookies. If the token is not present, it redirects the user to the login page. If the token is valid, it allows access to the protected routes.

    ```js
    // app/api/protected/route.js
    import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
    import jwt from "jsonwebtoken";
    export async function GET(request) {
      const token = request.cookies.get("authToken");

      if (!token) {
        return NextResponse.json({ error: "Unauthorized" }, { status: 401 });
      }

      try {
        const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
        // Handle the request for authorized users
        return NextResponse.json({
          message: "Protected data",
          userId: decoded.userId,
        });
      } catch (error) {
        return NextResponse.json({ error: "Invalid token" }, { status: 401 });
      }
    }
    ```

    In this example, the API route checks for the authentication token in the request cookies. If the token is not present, it returns a 401 Unauthorized response. If the token is valid, it returns the protected data.

23. ### The difference between `use server` and `use client` in Next.js?

    - **`use server`**: Indicates that the function should be executed on the server side. It allows you to write server-side logic that can be called from the client side.

    - **`use client`**: Indicates that the component should be rendered on the client side. It allows you to write client-side logic that can be executed in the browser.

    ```jsx
    // Example of use server
    "use server";

    export async function fetchData() {
      const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
      const data = await response.json();
      return data;
    }

    // Example of use client
    ("use client");

    export default function ClientComponent() {
      return <div>This component is rendered on the client side.</div>;
    }
    ```

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

24. ### Understand the concept of server actions in Next.js.

    Server actions in Next.js allow you to define functions that can be executed on the server side when a form is submitted or an action is triggered. These functions can handle data processing, database interactions, or any server-side logic.

    ```jsx
    // app/actions/submitForm.js
    "use server";

    export async function submitForm(formData) {
      const name = formData.get("name");
      console.log("Form submitted with name:", name);
      return { success: true };
    }
    ```

    You can then use this action in a form:

    ```jsx
    // app/form/page.js
    import { submitForm } from "../actions/submitForm";

    export default function FormPage() {
      return (
        <form action={submitForm}>
          <input type="text" name="name" />
          <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
      );
    }
    ```

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

25. ### Whats are the benifit of using server actions in Next.js?

    - **Performance**: Server actions allow you to offload heavy computations or data processing to the server, reducing the load on the client.
    - **Security**: Sensitive operations can be performed on the server, preventing exposure of sensitive data or logic to the client.
    - **Simplified Data Fetching**: You can fetch data directly in server actions without needing to manage client-side state or effects.
    - **Reduced Client Bundle Size**: By moving logic to the server, you can reduce the amount of JavaScript sent to the client, improving load times.

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

26. ### What's are the problem of using server actions in Next.js?

    - **Latency**: Server actions can introduce latency since they require a round trip to the server, which may not be ideal for real-time interactions.
    - **Complexity**: Managing server actions can add complexity to your application, especially if you have many actions or need to handle different states.
    - **Limited Client-Side Interactivity**: Since server actions are executed on the server, they may not provide the same level of interactivity as client-side functions.
    - **Debugging Challenges**: Debugging server actions can be more challenging compared to client-side code, as you may not have access to browser developer tools.

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

27. ### Alternative options instead of server actions in Next.js?

    - **API Routes**: You can create API routes to handle server-side logic and data fetching, which can be called from the client side.
    - **Client-Side Fetching**: Use client-side data fetching methods like `useEffect` or libraries like SWR or React Query to manage data on the client side.
    - **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Use SSG for pages that can be pre-rendered at build time, reducing the need for server actions.
    - **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Use SSR for dynamic pages that require server-side data fetching on each request.

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

28. ### Alternative solutions example of not using server actions in Next.js?

    Instead of using server actions, you can use API routes to handle form submissions or data processing. Here's an example:

    ```jsx
    // app/api/submitForm/route.js
    export async function POST(request) {
      const formData = await request.formData();
      const name = formData.get("name");
      console.log("Form submitted with name:", name);
      return new Response(JSON.stringify({ success: true }), {
        status: 200,
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      });
    }
    ```

    You can then call this API route from a client-side component:

    ```jsx
    // app/form/page.js
    export default function FormPage() {
      const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        const formData = new FormData(event.target);
        const response = await fetch("/api/submitForm", {
          method: "POST",
          body: formData,
        });
        const result = await response.json();
        console.log(result);
      };

      return (
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
          <input type="text" name="name" />
          <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
      );
    }
    ```

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

29. ### JWT Token in Next.js App Router?

    JSON Web Tokens (JWT) can be used in the Next.js App Router for authentication and authorization. You can create a JWT token upon user login and store it in a cookie or local storage. Then, you can verify the token in API routes or server-side functions to authenticate users.

    ```js
    import jwt from "jsonwebtoken";

    // Create a JWT token
    const token = jwt.sign({ userId: user.id }, process.env.JWT_SECRET, {
      expiresIn: "1h",
    });

    // Verify the JWT token
    jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET, (err, decoded) => {
      if (err) {
        return res.status(401).json({ error: "Invalid token" });
      }
      // Proceed with authenticated user
    });
    ```

    Using it on application:

    ```jsx
    // app/api/auth/route.js
    import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
    import jwt from "jsonwebtoken";
    export async function POST(request) {
      const { token } = await request.json();
      try {
        const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
        return NextResponse.json({ userId: decoded.userId });
      } catch (error) {
        return NextResponse.json({ error: "Invalid token" }, { status: 401 });
      }
    }
    ```

    You can also use JWT tokens for protecting API routes:

    ```js
    // app/api/protected/route.js
    import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
    import jwt from "jsonwebtoken";
    export async function GET(request) {
      const token = request.cookies.get("authToken");

      if (!token) {
        return NextResponse.json({ error: "Unauthorized" }, { status: 401 });
      }

      try {
        const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
        // Handle the request for authorized users
        return NextResponse.json({
          message: "Protected data",
          userId: decoded.userId,
        });
      } catch (error) {
        return NextResponse.json({ error: "Invalid token" }, { status: 401 });
      }
    }
    ```

30. ### Context of JWT Token in Next.js App Router?

    The context of using JWT tokens in the Next.js App Router is primarily for authentication and authorization purposes. JWT tokens allow you to securely transmit user information between the client and server, enabling you to verify user identity and permissions without needing to store session data on the server.

    This approach is particularly useful for stateless applications where you want to maintain user sessions without relying on server-side session storage.

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

31. ### Is App Router better than Pages Router in Next.js?

    The App Router offers more flexibility and features compared to the Pages Router, such as nested routes, layouts, and server components. It is designed for building complex applications with shared layouts and components.

    However, the choice between App Router and Pages Router depends on your specific use case. If you need simple routing without nested routes or layouts, the Pages Router may be sufficient.

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

32. ### How to handle global state management in Next.js with the App Router?

    You can handle global state management in Next.js with the App Router using libraries like Redux, Zustand, or React Context API. These libraries allow you to create a global store that can be accessed from any component in your application.

    - **Using React Context API**:

    ```jsx
    // app/context/GlobalState.js
    import { createContext, useContext, useState } from "react";

    const GlobalStateContext = createContext();

    export function GlobalStateProvider({ children }) {
      const [state, setState] = useState({ user: null });

      return (
        <GlobalStateContext.Provider value={{ state, setState }}>
          {children}
        </GlobalStateContext.Provider>
      );
    }

    export function useGlobalState() {
      return useContext(GlobalStateContext);
    }
    ```

    Then wrap your application with the `GlobalStateProvider`:

    ```jsx
    // app/layout.js
    import { GlobalStateProvider } from "./context/GlobalState";

    export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
      return (
        <html lang="en">
          <body>
            <GlobalStateProvider>{children}</GlobalStateProvider>
          </body>
        </html>
      );
    }
    ```

    Now you can access the global state in any component using the `useGlobalState` hook.

    ```jsx
    // app/page.js
    import { useGlobalState } from "./context/GlobalState";

    export default function HomePage() {
      const { state, setState } = useGlobalState();

      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Welcome, {state.user ? state.user.name : "Guest"}</h1>
          <button onClick={() => setState({ user: { name: "John Doe" } })}>
            Log In
          </button>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

33. ### What is the fetch API in Next.js App Router?

    In the Next.js App Router, you can use the `fetch` API to make HTTP requests to external APIs or your own API routes. The `fetch` function is available globally in both server and client components.

    - **Example of using fetch in a server component**:

    ```jsx
    // app/api/data/route.js
    export async function GET() {
      const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
      const data = await response.json();
      return new Response(JSON.stringify(data), {
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      });
    }
    ```

    - **Example of using fetch in a client component**:

    ```jsx
    // app/page.js
    import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

    export default function HomePage() {
      const [data, setData] = useState(null);

      useEffect(() => {
        async function fetchData() {
          const response = await fetch("/api/data");
          const result = await response.json();
          setData(result);
        }
        fetchData();
      }, []);

      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Data from API</h1>
          <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

34. ### How do you create route groups in the App Router?

    Route groups allow you to organize routes without affecting the URL structure. You create them by wrapping folder names in parentheses `()`.

    ```
    app/
    ├── (marketing)/
    │   ├── about/
    │   │   └── page.js     // /about
    │   └── contact/
    │       └── page.js     // /contact
    ├── (shop)/
    │   ├── products/
    │   │   └── page.js     // /products
    │   └── cart/
    │       └── page.js     // /cart
    └── layout.js           // Shared layout
    ```

    Route groups are useful for organizing code, creating different layouts for different sections, or conditionally including layouts.

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

35. ### What are parallel routes in Next.js App Router?

    Parallel routes allow you to render multiple pages simultaneously in the same layout. They are defined using slots with the `@` convention.

    ```
    app/
    ├── layout.js
    ├── page.js
    ├── @analytics/
    │   └── page.js
    └── @team/
        └── page.js
    ```

    ```jsx
    // app/layout.js
    export default function Layout({ children, analytics, team }) {
      return (
        <div>
          <div>{children}</div>
          <div>{analytics}</div>
          <div>{team}</div>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

    This allows you to render independent pages that can load at different speeds and handle their own loading and error states.

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

36. ### How do you implement intercepting routes in App Router?

    Intercepting routes allow you to load a route from another part of your application while keeping the context of the current page, similar to modals.

    ```
    app/
    ├── feed/
    │   └── page.js
    ├── photo/
    │   └── [id]/
    │       └── page.js
    └── @modal/
        └── (..)photo/
            └── [id]/
                └── page.js
    ```

    The `(..)` convention indicates that you want to intercept routes at the same level. Intercepting routes use conventions like:

    - `(.)` - match segments on the same level
    - `(..)` - match segments one level above
    - `(..)(..)` - match segments two levels above
    - `(...)` - match segments from the root app directory

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

37. ### What is the loading.js file in App Router?

    The `loading.js` file creates loading UI that shows instantly while route segments are loading. It automatically wraps the page and its children in a React Suspense boundary.

    ```jsx
    // app/dashboard/loading.js
    export default function Loading() {
      return (
        <div className="loading">
          <p>Loading dashboard...</p>
          <div className="spinner"></div>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

    ```
    app/
    ├── dashboard/
    │   ├── loading.js      // Loading UI for dashboard
    │   ├── page.js
    │   └── settings/
    │       ├── loading.js  // Loading UI for settings
    │       └── page.js
    ```

    The loading UI will be shown immediately on navigation and can be nested for granular loading states.

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

38. ### How do you handle not-found pages in App Router?

    You can create custom not-found pages using the `not-found.js` file. This file defines UI to render when the `notFound()` function is thrown within a route segment.

    ```jsx
    // app/not-found.js
    import Link from "next/link";

    export default function NotFound() {
      return (
        <div>
          <h2>Not Found</h2>
          <p>Could not find requested resource</p>
          <Link href="/">Return Home</Link>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

    You can also trigger the not-found page programmatically:

    ```jsx
    // app/page.js
    import { notFound } from "next/navigation";

    export default function Page({ params }) {
      const post = getPost(params.id);

      if (!post) {
        notFound();
      }

      return <div>{post.title}</div>;
    }
    ```

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

39. ### What is the template.js file in App Router?

    The `template.js` file is similar to `layout.js` but creates a new instance for each of its children on navigation. This means state is not preserved and effects are re-synchronized.

    ```jsx
    // app/template.js
    export default function Template({ children }) {
      return <div className="template-wrapper">{children}</div>;
    }
    ```

    Key differences from layout:

    - **Layout**: State is preserved, DOM elements are not re-created
    - **Template**: New instance on navigation, DOM elements are re-created

    Templates are useful when you need:

    - CSS/JS animations on route changes
    - Features that rely on `useEffect` and `useState`
    - To change the default browser behavior

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

40. ### How do you implement nested layouts in App Router?

    Nested layouts are implemented by creating `layout.js` files in different route segments. Layouts are nested automatically based on the folder structure.

    ```
    app/
    ├── layout.js           // Root layout
    ├── page.js             // Home page
    └── dashboard/
        ├── layout.js       // Dashboard layout
        ├── page.js         // Dashboard page
        └── settings/
            ├── layout.js   // Settings layout
            └── page.js     // Settings page
    ```

    ```jsx
    // app/layout.js (Root Layout)
    export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
      return (
        <html lang="en">
          <body>
            <nav>Global Navigation</nav>
            {children}
          </body>
        </html>
      );
    }

    // app/dashboard/layout.js
    export default function DashboardLayout({ children }) {
      return (
        <div className="dashboard">
          <aside>Dashboard Sidebar</aside>
          <main>{children}</main>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

    When visiting `/dashboard/settings`, all three layouts (root, dashboard, settings) will be rendered in a nested structure.

41. ### What are route handlers vs API routes in App Router?

    In the App Router, API routes are now called "Route Handlers" and use the `route.js` file convention instead of the pages-based approach.

    **Pages Router (API Routes)**:

    ```
    pages/api/users.js
    ```

    **App Router (Route Handlers)**:

    ```
    app/api/users/route.js
    ```

    ```jsx
    // app/api/users/route.js
    export async function GET(request) {
      const users = await getUsers();
      return Response.json(users);
    }

    export async function POST(request) {
      const data = await request.json();
      const user = await createUser(data);
      return Response.json(user, { status: 201 });
    }

    export async function PUT(request) {
      const data = await request.json();
      const user = await updateUser(data);
      return Response.json(user);
    }

    export async function DELETE(request) {
      await deleteUser(request.nextUrl.searchParams.get("id"));
      return new Response(null, { status: 204 });
    }
    ```

    Route handlers support all HTTP methods and provide better TypeScript support and Web APIs compatibility.

42. ### How do you handle streaming and suspense in App Router?

    The App Router has built-in support for streaming and React Suspense, allowing you to progressively render and stream UI to the client.

    ```jsx
    // app/page.js
    import { Suspense } from "react";

    async function UserProfile({ userId }) {
      const user = await getUserData(userId); // This can be slow
      return <div>Welcome, {user.name}!</div>;
    }

    async function UserPosts({ userId }) {
      const posts = await getUserPosts(userId); // This can also be slow
      return (
        <div>
          {posts.map((post) => (
            <div key={post.id}>{post.title}</div>
          ))}
        </div>
      );
    }

    export default function Page({ params }) {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>User Dashboard</h1>
          <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading profile...</div>}>
            <UserProfile userId={params.id} />
          </Suspense>
          <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading posts...</div>}>
            <UserPosts userId={params.id} />
          </Suspense>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

    Benefits of streaming:

    - Faster initial page load
    - Better perceived performance
    - Progressive enhancement
    - SEO-friendly as search engines can index content as it streams

43. ### What is React Server Components (RSC) in App Router?

    React Server Components (RSC) are a new React feature that allows components to be rendered on the server. In the App Router, components are Server Components by default.

    **Server Components** (default):

    ```jsx
    // app/page.js - This is a Server Component
    async function ServerComponent() {
      const data = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
      const result = await data.json();

      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Server Rendered Data</h1>
          <p>{result.message}</p>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

    **Client Components** (opt-in with "use client"):

    ```jsx
    // app/components/ClientComponent.js
    "use client";

    import { useState } from "react";

    export default function ClientComponent() {
      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

      return (
        <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Count: {count}</button>
      );
    }
    ```

    **Benefits of Server Components**:

    - Direct access to server-side resources (databases, file system)
    - No JavaScript bundle sent to client
    - Improved performance and SEO
    - Automatic code splitting

    **When to use Client Components**:

    - Interactive features (event handlers, state)
    - Browser-only APIs (localStorage, geolocation)
    - React hooks (useState, useEffect)

44. ### How do you handle error boundaries in App Router?

    You can create error boundaries using the `error.js` file in a route segment. This file defines UI to render when an error is thrown within that segment.

    ```jsx
    // app/error.js
    import Link from "next/link";

    export default function Error({ error, reset }) {
      return (
        <div>
          <h2>Something went wrong!</h2>
          <p>{error.message}</p>
          <button onClick={reset}>Try Again</button>
          <Link href="/">Return Home</Link>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

    You can also throw errors programmatically:

    ```jsx
    // app/page.js
    export default function Page() {
      throw new Error("An unexpected error occurred!");
      return <div>This will not be rendered.</div>;
    }
    ```

    The error boundary will catch the error and display the custom error UI defined in `error.js`.

45. ### How do you differentiate between server and client components in Next.js?

    In Next.js, components are Server Components by default. To differentiate and create Client Components, you need to add the `"use client"` directive at the top of the component file.

    - **Server Components**: These run on the server and can access server-side resources like databases and file systems. They do not include any client-side JavaScript in the bundle.

      ```jsx
      // app/page.js - This is a Server Component
      async function ServerComponent() {
        const data = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
        const result = await data.json();

        return (
          <div>
            <h1>Server Rendered Data</h1>
            <p>{result.message}</p>
          </div>
        );
      }
      ```

    - **Client Components**: These run on the client side and can use React hooks, manage state, and handle user interactions. They must include the `"use client"` directive.

      ```jsx
      // app/components/ClientComponent.js
      "use client";

      import { useState } from "react";

      export default function ClientComponent() {
        const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

        return (
          <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Count: {count}</button>
        );
      }
      ```

    Use Server Components for static content and data fetching, and Client Components for interactivity and state management.

46. ### How do you handle internationalization (i18n) in Next.js with the App Router?

    Next.js provides built-in support for internationalization (i18n) in the App Router. You can configure i18n settings in the `next.config.js` file.

    ```js
    // next.config.js
    module.exports = {
      i18n: {
        locales: ["en", "fr", "de"],
        defaultLocale: "en",
      },
    };
    ```

    You can then create localized content by using dynamic route segments for different languages.

    ```
    app/
    ├── [locale]/
    │   ├── page.js         // Localized home page
    │   └── about/
    │       └── page.js     // Localized about page
    ```

    ```jsx
    // app/[locale]/page.js
    import { useRouter } from "next/router";

    export default function HomePage() {
      const { locale } = useRouter();

      return <div>Welcome to the {locale} version of the site!</div>;
    }
    ```

    You can also use libraries like `next-translate` or `react-i18next` for more advanced i18n features.

47. ### What is use server, why and when to use it in Next.js?

    The `"use server"` directive in Next.js is used to indicate that a function should be executed on the server side. It allows you to write server-side logic that can be called from the client side, such as handling form submissions or processing data.

    You should use `"use server"` when you need to perform operations that require server-side capabilities, such as:

    - Accessing databases or file systems
    - Performing secure operations that should not be exposed to the client
    - Handling form submissions and processing data on the server

    Example usage:

    ```jsx
    // app/form-example/page.js
    "use server";

    export async function handleSubmit(formData) {
      const name = formData.get("name");
      console.log("Form submitted with name:", name);
      return { success: true };
    }

    export default function FormExample() {
      return (
        <form action={handleSubmit}>
          <input type="text" name="name" />
          <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
      );
    }
    ```

    In this example, the `handleSubmit` function is marked with `"use server"`, indicating that it will run on the server when the form is submitted.

48. ### What are the best practices of nextjs api routes?

    - Use proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for different operations.
    - Validate and sanitize input data to prevent security vulnerabilities.
    - Handle errors gracefully and return appropriate HTTP status codes.
    - Use middleware for common tasks like authentication and logging.
    - Keep API routes modular and organized in separate files or folders.
    - Optimize performance by caching responses when appropriate.
    - Document your API endpoints for easier consumption by other developers.

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

49. ### How to use proper HTTP methods in Next.js API routes?

    In Next.js API routes, you can define different functions for each HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) within the same route file. This allows you to handle different types of requests appropriately.

    Example:

    ```jsx
    // app/api/users/route.js
    export async function GET(request) {
      const users = await getUsers();
      return new Response(JSON.stringify(users), {
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      });
    }

    export async function POST(request) {
      const data = await request.json();
      const user = await createUser(data);
      return new Response(JSON.stringify(user), {
        status: 201,
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      });
    }

    export async function PUT(request) {
      const data = await request.json();
      const user = await updateUser(data);
      return new Response(JSON.stringify(user), {
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      });
    }

    export async function DELETE(request) {
      const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url);
      const userId = searchParams.get("id");
      await deleteUser(userId);
      return new Response(null, { status: 204 });
    }
    ```

    In this example, each function corresponds to a specific HTTP method, allowing you to handle requests accordingly.

50. ### How to validate and sanitize input data in Next.js API routes?

    To validate and sanitize input data in Next.js API routes, you can use libraries like `Joi`, `Yup`, or `validator.js`. These libraries help ensure that the data received from clients meets the expected format and is safe to use.

    Example using `Joi`:

    ```jsx
    // app/api/users/route.js
    import Joi from "joi";

    const userSchema = Joi.object({
      name: Joi.string().min(3).max(30).required(),
      email: Joi.string().email().required(),
      age: Joi.number().integer().min(0).optional(),
    });

    export async function POST(request) {
      const data = await request.json();

      // Validate input data
      const { error, value } = userSchema.validate(data);
      if (error) {
        return new Response(
          JSON.stringify({ error: error.details[0].message }),
          {
            status: 400,
            headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
          }
        );
      }

      // Proceed with sanitized data
      const user = await createUser(value);
      return new Response(JSON.stringify(user), {
        status: 201,
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      });
    }
    ```

    In this example, the `userSchema` defines the expected structure of the input data. The `POST` function validates the incoming data against this schema and returns an error response if validation fails.
